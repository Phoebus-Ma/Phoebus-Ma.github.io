# 27. Window Managers
--------

Window Managers and Desktop Environments are the primary user interfaces into the X Window System. A window manager is a program that controls the appearance of windows and provides the means by which the user can interact with them. A Desktop Environment provides a more complete interface to the operating system, and provides a range of integrated utilities and applications.

There are many Window Managers available. Some of the more well known ones include fvwm2, Window Maker, AfterStep, Enlightenment, Sawfish, and Blackbox.

The Desktop Environments available for Linux are GNOME, KDE, and XFce.

Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective. The choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources (RAM, disk space) required, and the utilities included. One web site that provides a very good summary of what is available, screenshots, and their respective features is [Window Managers for X](http://www.xwinman.org/).

In this chapter, the installation instructions of several Window Managers and one lightweight Desktop Environment are presented. Later in the book, both KDE and GNOME have their own sections.


## 27.1 Fluxbox-1.3.7

### Fluxbox Dependencies

#### Required

[a graphical environment](24.Graphical_environments.md)

#### Optional

[dbus-1.14.6](12.System_utilities.md#1210-dbus-1146) (runtime), [FriBidi-1.0.12](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#106-fribidi-1012), and [imlib2-1.9.1](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2529-imlib2-191) (if you wish to use other image formats in addition to XPM)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fluxbox](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fluxbox)

Installation of Fluxbox
-----------------------

First, fix a build failure when building with gcc-11.1:

```bash
sed -i '/text_prop.value > 0/s/>/!=/' util/fluxbox-remote.cc
```

Install Fluxbox by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make
```

This package does not have a working test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Configuring Fluxbox
-------------------

### 

#### Config Files

`~/.fluxbox/init`, `~/.fluxbox/keys`, and `~/.fluxbox/menu`

#### Configuration Information

If Fluxbox is the only Window Manager you want to use, you can start it with an `.xinitrc` file in your home folder. Be sure to backup your current `.xinitrc` before proceeding.

```bash
echo startfluxbox > ~/.xinitrc
```

Or alternatively, if you use a login manager like [GDM-43.0](26.Display_managers.md#261-gdm-430) or [lightdm-1.32.0](26.Display_managers.md#262-lightdm-1320), and would like to be able to choose Fluxbox at the login prompt, create a `fluxbox.desktop` file. As `root`:

```bash
mkdir -pv /usr/share/xsessions &&
cat > /usr/share/xsessions/fluxbox.desktop << "EOF"
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Fluxbox
Comment=This session logs you into Fluxbox
Exec=startfluxbox
Type=Application
EOF
```

If you didn't install [GDM-43.0](26.Display_managers.md#261-gdm-430) or [lightdm-1.32.0](26.Display_managers.md#262-lightdm-1320) in `/usr`, then change that command to fit the prefix you chose.

Now create the Fluxbox configuration files:

```bash
mkdir -v ~/.fluxbox &&
cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/init ~/.fluxbox/init &&
cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/keys ~/.fluxbox/keys
```

To generate the application menu, first you may wish to run **fluxbox-generate_menu -h**, in order to choose any `<user_options>`, then issue:

```bash
cd ~/.fluxbox &&
fluxbox-generate_menu <user_options>
```

Alternately, copy a pregenerated menu:

```bash
cp -v /usr/share/fluxbox/menu ~/.fluxbox/menu
```

Menu items are added by editing `~/.fluxbox/menu`. The syntax is explained on the **fluxbox** man page.

If you want to use an image as your desktop background, copy the theme you like into `~/.fluxbox`. Then add a line to make it use the correct image. In the following command, change `<theme>` for the name of the theme you want and change `</path/to/nice/image.ext>` to point to the actual image you want to use, where `ext` must be “xpm”, if [imlib2-1.9.1](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2529-imlib2-191) is not installed to allow other image formats.

```bash
cp -r /usr/share/fluxbox/styles/<theme> ~/.fluxbox/theme &&

sed -i 's,\(session.styleFile:\).*,\1 ~/.fluxbox/theme,' ~/.fluxbox/init &&

[ -f ~/.fluxbox/theme ] &&
echo "background.pixmap: </path/to/nice/image.ext>" >> ~/.fluxbox/theme ||
[ -d ~/.fluxbox/theme ] &&
echo "background.pixmap: </path/to/nice/image.ext>" >> ~/.fluxbox/theme/theme.cfg
```

In some locales the font specified in the theme may not contain the needed characters. This results in menus with blank items. You can fix this by editing `~/.fluxbox/theme` with a text editor and altering it so that it names a suitable font.

## 27.2 IceWM-3.3.1
--------

Introduction to IceWM
---------------------

IceWM is a window manager with the goals of speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user's way.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Package Information

### IceWM Dependencies

#### Required

[CMake-3.25.2](13.Programming.md#134-cmake-3252), [a graphical environment](24.Graphical_environments.md), and [gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.40.2](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2514-gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2402)

#### Optional

[asciidoc-10.2.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) (for regenerating the HTML documentation), [FriBidi-1.0.12](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#106-fribidi-1012) (for languages written right to left), [imlib2-1.9.1](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2529-imlib2-191), [librsvg-2.54.5](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1022-librsvg-2545), [libao-1.2.0](42.Multimedia_libraries_and_drivers.md#4224-libao-120), [libsndfile-1.2.0](42.Multimedia_libraries_and_drivers.md#4241-libsndfile-120), and [alsa-lib-1.2.8](42.Multimedia_libraries_and_drivers.md#422-alsa-lib-128) (for the experimental icesound program)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/icewm](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/icewm)

Installation of IceWM
---------------------

Install IceWM by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
      -DCFGDIR=/etc               \
      -DENABLE_LTO=ON             \
      -DCONFIG_GDK_PIXBUF_XLIB=ON \
      -DCONFIG_IMLIB2=OFF         \
      -DDOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/icewm-3.3.1  \
      .. &&
make
```

This package does not have a working test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

This package creates two `.desktop` files in the `/usr/share/xsessions/` directory. Both are not needed in a BLFS system, so prevent the extra file showing up as an option in a display manager. As the `root` user:

```bash
rm -v /usr/share/xsessions/icewm.desktop
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`-DENABLE_LTO=ON`: This option enables Link Time Optimization and is required for this package.

Configuring IceWM
-----------------

### 

#### Config Files

`~/.icewm/keys`, `~/.icewm/menu`, and `~/.icewm/preferences`, and `~/.icewm/toolbar`, and `~/.icewm/winoptions`. The default versions are installed in `/usr/share/icewm/` and will be used if you have not copied them to `~/.icewm`.

#### Configuration Information

If IceWM is the only Window Manager you want to use, you can start it with an `.xinitrc` file in your home folder. Be sure to backup your current `.xinitrc` before proceeding.

```bash
echo icewm-session > ~/.xinitrc
```

Now create the IceWM configuration files:

```bash
mkdir -pv ~/.icewm                                      &&
cp -v /usr/share/icewm/keys ~/.icewm/keys               &&
cp -v /usr/share/icewm/menu ~/.icewm/menu               &&
cp -v /usr/share/icewm/preferences ~/.icewm/preferences &&
cp -v /usr/share/icewm/toolbar ~/.icewm/toolbar         &&
cp -v /usr/share/icewm/winoptions ~/.icewm/winoptions
```

You can now edit these files to meet your requirements. In particular, review the `preferences` file. You can use **Logout -> Restart-IceWM** on the main menu to load your changed preferences, but changes to the background only take effect when IceWM is started.

At this point you can either modify the traditional menu files to suit your requirements, _or_ use the newer **icewm-menu-fdo** described later.

The syntax of the menus is explained in the help files, which you can access by running **help** from the menu, but some of the detail is out of date and the default selections in the menus (a few old applications on the main menu, everything else on the **Programs** menu) will benefit from being updated to meet your needs. The following examples are provided to encourage you to think about how you wish to organise your menus. Please note the following:

*   If a program listed in the menu has not been installed, it will not appear when the menu is displayed. Similarly, if the program exists but the specified icon does not, no icon will be displayed in the menu.
    
*   The icons can be either `.xpm` or `.png` files, and there is no need to specify the extension. If the icon is located in the "library" (`/usr/share/icewm/icons`) there is no need to specify the path.
    
*   Most programs are in sub-menus, and the main menu will always append entries for `windows, help, settings, logout` at the bottom.
    
*   An icon for firefox was copied to the library directory and given a meaningful name. The icon for xine is `xine.xpm` which was installed to a pixmap directory.
    
*   The default toolbar is not altered.
    

If you wish to use this traditional method, there are more examples in previous releases of this book (e.g. BLFS-7.8).

Alternatively, you can create a menu which conforms to the FDO Desktop Menu Specifications, where programs can be found because they have a .desktop file in the XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_DATA_DIR directories. Unlike most windowmanagers, icewm does not search for programs when the menu is invoked, so if you take this route you will need to rerun the following command after installing or removing programs:

```bash
icewm-menu-fdo >~/.icewm/menu
```

If you wish to put icons on your desktop, you will need to install a program such as [Rox-Filer-2.11](41.Other_x-based_programs.md#419-rox-filer-211) which provides a pinboard. If you do that you will no longer be able to access the menu by right-clicking on the desktop, you will have to use the IceWM button. To ensure that the rox pinboard is running, the following commands will put it in the startup file:

```bash
cat > ~/.icewm/startup << "EOF"
rox -p Default &
EOF &&
chmod +x ~/.icewm/startup
```

### Tip

There are a number of keyboard shortcuts in IceWM:

*   Ctrl + Alt + F`N` : go to ``tty`N```.
    
*   Ctrl + Alt + `N` : go to desktop number `N`
    
*   Ctrl + Alt + Space : open a box on the taskbar where you can key in the name of an application and run it.

## 27.3 openbox-3.6.1
--------

Introduction to openbox
-----------------------

Openbox is a highly configurable desktop window manager with extensive standards support. It allows you to control almost every aspect of how you interact with your desktop.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Package Information

*   Download (HTTP): [http://openbox.org/dist/openbox/openbox-3.6.1.tar.gz](http://openbox.org/dist/openbox/openbox-3.6.1.tar.gz)

*   Download size: 944 KB
    
*   Estimated disk space required: 21 MB
    
*   Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU
    

### Openbox Dependencies

#### Required

[a graphical environment](24.Graphical_environments.md) and [Pango-1.50.12](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2542-pango-15012) (compiled with support for libXft)

#### Optional

[dbus-1.14.6](12.System_utilities.md#1210-dbus-1146) (runtime), [imlib2-1.9.1](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2529-imlib2-191) (to enable icons in the right click menu), [ImageMagick-7.1.0-61](11.General_utilities.md#1110-imagemagick-710-61) (to show desktop backgrounds as seen in the Configuration Information section below), [PyXDG-0.28](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules), [startup-notification-0.12](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2546-startup-notification-012), and [librsvg-2.54.5](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1022-librsvg-2545)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openbox](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openbox)

Installation of Openbox
-----------------------

### Note

If XORG_PREFIX is not `/usr`, tell **gcc** about it:

```bash
export LIBRARY_PATH=$XORG_PREFIX/lib
```

If you only installed the Python 3 PyXDG module convert one of the scripts to Python 3:

```bash
2to3-3.11 -w data/autostart/openbox-xdg-autostart &&
sed 's/python/python3/' -i data/autostart/openbox-xdg-autostart
```

Install Openbox by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr     \
            --sysconfdir=/etc \
            --disable-static  \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/openbox-3.6.1 &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

This package creates three `.desktop` files in the `/usr/share/xsessions/` directory. Two of these are not appropriate in a BLFS system, so prevent the extra files showing up as options in a display manager. As the `root` user:

```bash
rm -v /usr/share/xsessions/openbox-{gnome,kde}.desktop
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--sysconfdir=/etc`: This option puts Openbox's configuration files in /etc/xdg/openbox instead of /usr/etc/xdg/openbox.

`--docdir=/usr/share/doc/openbox-3.6.1`: this puts a few files in a versioned directory in `/usr/share/doc`.

`--disable-static`: This switch prevents installation of static versions of the libraries.

Configuring Openbox
-------------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/xdg/openbox/autostart`, `/etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml`, `/etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml`, `~/.config/openbox/autostart`, `~/.config/openbox/menu.xml` and `~/.config/openbox/rc.xml`

#### Configuration Information

Openbox's right click menu can be used to launch programs. The menu itself is configured with 2 files, `/etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml` and `~/.config/openbox/menu.xml`. To make changes to the menu, copy /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml to ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml and edit it:

```bash
cp -rf /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config
```

`~/.config/openbox/menu.xml` can be edited with a text editor or you can install [Obmenu](https://obmenu.sourceforge.net/) (requires [pyxml](https://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/) and [PyGTK-2.24.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules)).

To have icons in your right click menu requires installing [imlib2-1.9.1](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2529-imlib2-191) before you install Openbox. To set an icon for an entry in the menu edit `~/.config/openbox/menu.xml` and add an icon to the <item> tag like this:

```bash
        <item label="Mplayer" icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/mplayer.png">
```

Many other aspects of Openbox's behavior are configured with `~/.config/openbox/rc.xml` such as what keybindings are used to launch programs or which mouse button launches the main menu.

Details of the theme that Openbox applies to window decorations are configured in `~/.config/openbox/rc.xml`. You can get a list of the available themes with the command:

```bash
ls -d /usr/share/themes/*/openbox-3 | sed 's#.*es/##;s#/o.*##'
```

#### Starting Openbox

To automatically start **openbox** when you start Xorg:

```bash
echo openbox > ~/.xinitrc
```

If you want to set a background image to your desktop you can use [**display**](11.General_utilities.md#1110-imagemagick-710-61) and launch it from ~/.xinitrc just before openbox:

```bash
cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
display -backdrop -window root /path/to/beautiful/picture.jpeg
exec openbox
EOF
```

Or if you like a bit of variety, put a selection of images in a folder (in this example, the directory ~/.config/backgrounds) and choose one at random each time you **xinit**:

```bash
cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
# make an array which lists the pictures:
picture_list=(~/.config/backgrounds/*)
# create a random integer between 0 and the number of pictures:
random_number=$(( ${RANDOM} % ${#picture_list[@]} ))
# display the chosen picture:
display -backdrop -window root "${picture_list[${random_number}]}"
exec openbox
EOF
```

If you like to have the numlock key set when you start Xorg, install [Numlockx](https://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/numlockx/numlockx_1.2.orig.tar.gz) and add that to your xinitrc. Another useful application is [dbus-1.14.6](12.System_utilities.md#1210-dbus-1146):

```bash
cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
. /etc/profile
picture_list=(~/.config/backgrounds/*)
random_number=$(( ${RANDOM} % ${#picture_list[*]} ))
display -backdrop -window root "${picture_list[${random_number}]}"
numlockx
eval $(dbus-launch --auto-syntax --exit-with-session)
lxpanel &
exec openbox
EOF
```

## 27.4 sawfish-1.13.0
--------

Introduction to sawfish
-----------------------

The sawfish package contains a window manager. This is useful for organizing and displaying windows where all window decorations are configurable and all user-interface policy is controlled through the extension language.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sawfish](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/sawfish)

Installation of sawfish
-----------------------

Install sawfish by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-pango  &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

This package creates six `.desktop` files in the `/usr/share/xsessions/` directory. All but one are needed in a BLFS system, so prevent the extra files showing up as options in a display manager. As the `root` user:

```bash
rm -v /usr/share/xsessions/sawfish-*.desktop
```

Configuring sawfish

Be sure to backup your current `.xinitrc` before proceeding.

```bash
cat >> ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
exec sawfish
EOF
```

Optionally, you can use a Display Manager, such as [lxdm-0.5.3](26.Display_managers.md#263-lxdm-053).

From the developers: “The default menu binding is somewhat obscure; you must middle-click on the background to bring up the menus. (If you have a two-button mouse, try clicking both buttons simultaneously)”. You can find this at [sawfish's FAQ](https://download.tuxfamily.org/sawfish/themes/FAQ.html/).
