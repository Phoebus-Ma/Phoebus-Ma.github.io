```bash
rm -fv /usr/bin/desktop-file-edit
```

Install Desktop File Utils by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

meson --prefix=/usr --buildtype=release .. &&
ninja
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
ninja install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--buildtype=release`: Specify a buildtype suitable for stable releases of the package, as the default may produce unoptimized binaries.

Configuring Desktop File Utils
------------------------------

#### Configuration Information

The [XDG Base Directory](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) specification defines the standard locations for applications to place data and configuration files. These files can be used, for instance, to define the menu structure and menu items in a desktop environment.

The default location for configuration files to be installed is `/etc/xdg`, and the default locations for data files are `/usr/local/share` and `/usr/share`. These locations can be extended with the environment variables `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, respectively. The GNOME, KDE and XFCE environments respect these settings.

When a package installs a `.desktop` file to a location in one of the base data directories, the database that maps MIME-types to available applications can be updated. For instance, the cache file at `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache` can be rebuilt by executing the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
install -vdm755 /usr/share/applications &&
update-desktop-database /usr/share/applications
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** desktop-file-edit, desktop-file-install, desktop-file-validate and update-desktop-database

**Installed Libraries:** None

### Short Descriptions

**desktop-file-edit**           is used to modify an existing desktop file entry.

**desktop-file-install**        is used to install a new desktop file entry. It is also used to rebuild or modify the MIME-types application database.

**desktop-file-validate**       is used to verify the integrity of a desktop file.

**update-desktop-database**     is used to update the MIME-types application database.

### Graphviz Dependencies

### Note

Graphviz basic usage does not need any libraries out of what is found in the LFS book. Its “core” rendering engine allows to generate several graphic formats, such as Postscript, SVG, VML, .fig, and Tk. Those formats can be converted to almost any other format using for example tools from [ImageMagick-7.1.0-61](11.General_utilities.md#1110-imagemagick-710-61). The dependencies below add the ability to generate graph images in bitmap format, to display the graph image on screen, to edit a graph by viewing the resulting image directly, or to view large graphs. Since Graphviz is a dependency of several other packages in this book, it is suggested to first build it without any dependencies, then to rebuild it when you have built enough packages to suit your needs.

#### Optional, for various bitmap outputs

[Pango-1.50.12](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2542-pango-15012), with [Cairo-1.17.6](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#254-cairo-1176), [Xorg Libraries](24.Graphical_environments.md#248-xorg-libraries), [Fontconfig-2.14.2](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#105-fontconfig-2142), and [libpng-1.6.39](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1020-libpng-1639), to generate images in bitmap SVG, postscript, PNG, and PDF formats, or displaying the image on screen. The PNG output is required for building [gegl-0.4.40](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#107-gegl-0440)

Adding [GTK+-2.24.33](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2520-gtk-22433) with [libjpeg-turbo-2.1.5.1](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1017-libjpeg-turbo-2151) adds support for JPEG, BMP, TIF, and ICO formats, and allows displaying the image in a GTK+ window

[GD Library](https://www.libgd.org/) may be used instead of Pango. It adds the ability to generate images in GIF, VRML, and GD formats, but Pango provides better outputs for the other formats, and is needed for displaying images

Other formats may be added with [libwebp-1.3.0](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1025-libwebp-130) (WebP support is considered experimental), [DevIL](https://openil.sourceforge.net/projects.php), [libLASi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lasi/), and [glitz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/glitz)

#### Optional, to load graphic images that may be displayed inside the nodes of a graph

`libgs.so` from [ghostscript-10.00.0](46.Printing.md#463-ghostscript-10000), [librsvg-2.54.5](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1022-librsvg-2545), and [Poppler-23.02.0](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1031-poppler-23020)

#### Optional, to build more tools

[Freeglut-3.4.0](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2512-freeglut-340) (with [libglade-2.6.4](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2539-libglade-264), [GtkGLExt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkglext/), and [libGTS](https://gts.sourceforge.net/), for building the **smyrna** large graph viewer, which is considered experimental), and [Qt-5.15.8](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2544-qt-5158) (for building the **gvedit** graph editor.)

#### Optional (To Build Language Bindings)

[SWIG-4.1.1](13.Programming.md#1332-swig-411) (SWIG must be installed or no bindings will be built), [GCC-12.2.0](13.Programming.md#136-gcc-1220) (for the go compiler), [Guile-3.0.9](13.Programming.md#1311-guile-309), [OpenJDK-19.0.2](13.Programming.md#1339-openjdk-1902), [Lua-5.4.4](13.Programming.md#1314-lua-544), [PHP-8.2.3](13.Programming.md#1321-php-823), [Ruby-3.2.1](13.Programming.md#1326-ruby-321), [Tk-8.6.13](13.Programming.md#1334-tk-8613), [Io](https://iolanguage.org/), [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page), [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

#### Optional (building tools)

[Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) (framework for tests) and [Electric Fence](https://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Debuggers/Electric-Fence-3305.shtml/)

#### Optional (for building the pdf documentation)

[ghostscript-10.00.0](46.Printing.md#463-ghostscript-10000) (for the **ps2pdf** command)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/graphviz](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/graphviz)

Installation of Graphviz
------------------------

Install Graphviz by running the following commands:

```bash
sed -i '/LIBPOSTFIX="64"/s/64//' configure.ac &&

./autogen.sh              &&
./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/graphviz-7.1.0
```

### Note

A warning is generated by **autogen.sh** because the build tree is not a git repository. As a result, the build date is set to 0. To get a meaningful date in the version string, you can run:

```bash
sed -i "s/0/$(date +%Y%m%d)/" builddate.h
```

Whether or not you fix the date, proceed to compile the package:

```bash
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite that provides meaningful results.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**sed ... configure.ac**: This command is needed to avoid installing files in /usr/lib64.

`--with-javaincludedir="$JAVA_HOME/include -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux"`: If you have built [OpenJDK-19.0.2](13.Programming.md#1339-openjdk-1902) in /opt, and you want to build the JAVA bindings, it is necessary to specify the location of the JAVA header files to configure. The configure switch is designed for only one directory, but two directories need to be included. This is possible nevertheless by using the -I switch inside the variable.

`--with-webp`: Even if [libwebp-1.3.0](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1025-libwebp-130) is installed, it is not included in the build without this option.

`--with-smyrna`: Even if the needed dependencies are installed, the interactive graph viewer **smyrna** is not built without this option.

Configuring Graphviz
--------------------

#### Config Files

`/usr/lib/graphviz/config`

#### Configuration Information

There are no specific configuration requirements for Graphviz. You may consider installing the additional plugins and tools available from the download page at [https://graphviz.org/download/source/](https://graphviz.org/download/source/) for additional capabilities. If additional plugins are installed, you can run **dot -c** (as the `root` user) to update the `config` file in `/usr/lib/graphviz`.

Contents

**Installed Directories:** /usr/include/graphviz, /usr/lib/graphviz, /usr/lib/tcl8.6/graphviz, /usr/share/doc/graphviz-7.1.0, and /usr/share/graphviz

### Short Descriptions

**acyclic**             is a filter that takes a directed graph as input and outputs a copy of the graph with sufficient edges reversed to make the graph acyclic.

**bcomps**              decomposes graphs into their biconnected components, printing the components to standard output.

**ccomps**              decomposes graphs into their connected components, printing the components to standard output.

**circo**               draws graphs using a circular layout.

**cluster**             takes a graph in DOT format as input, finds node clusters and then augments the graph with this information.

**diffimg**             (needs [GD Library](https://www.libgd.org/)) generates an image where each pixel is the difference between the corresponding pixel in each of the two source images.

**dijkstra**            reads a stream of graphs and for each computes the distance of every node from sourcenode.

**dot**                 draws directed graphs. It works well on DAGs and other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies. It reads attributed graph files and writes drawings. By default, the output format dot is the input file with layout coordinates appended.

**dot2gxl**             converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the DOT language. Unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, **gxl2dot** will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a `.dot` suffix causing a conversion from DOT to GXL, and a `.gxl` suffix causing a conversion from GXL to DOT.

**edgepaint**           performs edge coloring to disambiguate crossing edges.

**fdp**                 draws undirected graphs using a “spring” model. It relies on a force-directed approach in the spirit of Fruchterman and Reingold.

**gc**                  is a graph analogue to **wc** in that it prints to standard output the number of nodes, edges, connected components or clusters contained in the input files. It also prints a total count for all graphs if more than one graph is given.

**gml2gv**              converts a graph specified in the GML format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format.

**graphml2gv**          converts a graph specified in the GRAPHML format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format.

**gv2gml**              converts a graph specified in the GV format to a graph in the GML format.

**gv2gxl**              converts a graph specified in the GV format to a graph in the GXL format.

**gvcolor**             is a filter that sets node colors from initial seed values. Colors flow along edges from tail to head, and are averaged (as HSB vectors) at nodes.

**gvedit**              provides a simple graph editor and viewer. It allows many graphs to be viewed at the same time. The text of each graph is displayed in its own text window.

**gvgen**               generates a variety of simple, regularly-structured abstract graphs.

**gvmap**               takes as input a graph in DOT format, finds node clusters and produces a rendering of the graph as a geographic-style map, with clusters highlighted, in xdot format.

**gvmap.sh**            is a pipeline for running gvmap.

**gvpack**              reads in a stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a single layout, and produces a single graph serving as the union of the input graphs.

**gvpr**                is a graph stream editor inspired by **awk**. It copies input graphs to its output, possibly transforming their structure and attributes, creating new graphs, or printing arbitrary information.

**gxl2dot**             converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the DOT language. Unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, **gxl2dot** will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a `.dot` suffix causing a conversion from DOT to GXL, and a `.gxl` suffix causing a conversion from GXL to DOT.

**gxl2gv**              converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the GV language.

**mm2gv**               converts a sparse matrix of the Matrix Market format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format.

**neato**               draws undirected graphs using “spring” models. Input files must be formatted in the **dot** attributed graph language. By default, the output of **neato** is the input graph with layout coordinates appended.

**nop**                 reads a stream of graphs and prints each in pretty-printed (canonical) format on stdout. If no files are given, it reads from stdin.

**osage**               draws clustered graphs. It takes any graph in DOT format as input.

**patchwork**           draws clustered graphs using a squarified treemap layout. It takes any graph in DOT format as input.

**prune**               reads directed graphs in the same format used by **dot** and removes subgraphs rooted at nodes specified on the command line via options.

**sccmap**              decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components. In this map, each component is collapsed into a node. The resulting graphs are printed to stdout.

**sfdp**                draws undirected graphs using the “spring” model, but it uses a multi-scale approach to produce layouts of large graphs in a reasonably short time.

**tred**                computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs, and prints the resulting graphs to standard output. This removes edges implied by transitivity. Nodes and subgraphs are not otherwise affected.

**twopi**               draws graphs using a radial layout. Basically, one node is chosen as the center and put at the origin. The remaining nodes are placed on a sequence of concentric circles centered about the origin, each a fixed radial distance from the previous circle.

**unflatten**           is a preprocessor to **dot** that is used to improve the aspect ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected nodes. The usual layout for such a graph is generally very wide or tall.

**vimdot**              is a simple script which launches the **gvim** or **vim** editor along with a GUI window showing the **dot** output of the edited file.

`libcdt.so`             manages run-time dictionaries using standard container data types: unordered set/multiset, ordered set/multiset, list, stack, and queue.

`libcgraph.so`          supports graph programming by maintaining graphs in memory and reading and writing graph files. Graphs are composed of nodes, edges, and nested subgraphs.

`libgvc.so`             provides a context for applications wishing to manipulate and render graphs. It provides command line parsing interfaces, common rendering code, and a plugin mechanism for renderers.

`libpathplan.so`        contains functions to find the shortest path between two points in a simple polygon.

`libxdot.so`            provides support for parsing and deparsing graphical operations specified by the xdot language.


## 11.7 GTK-Doc-1.33.2
--------

Introduction to GTK-Doc
-----------------------

The GTK-Doc package contains a code documenter. This is useful for extracting specially formatted comments from the code to create API documentation. This package is optional; if it is not installed, packages will not build the documentation. This does not mean that you will not have any documentation. If GTK-Doc is not available, the install process will copy any pre-built documentation to your system.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ibus](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ibus)

Installation of ibus
--------------------

If the optional Unicode Character Database was downloaded, install it now as the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -p                /usr/share/unicode/ucd &&
unzip -uo ../UCD.zip -d /usr/share/unicode/ucd
```

### Note

Be sure to also remove the --disable-unicode-dict in the configure step below.

Fix an issue with deprecated schema entries:

```bash
sed -i 's@/desktop/ibus@/org/freedesktop/ibus@g' \
    data/dconf/org.freedesktop.ibus.gschema.xml
```

Install ibus by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr          \
            --sysconfdir=/etc      \
            --disable-python2      \
            --disable-emoji-dict   \
            --disable-unicode-dict &&
rm -f tools/main.c                 &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make -k check**. The test named ibus-compose fails because it uses some locales not installed in LFS. The test named ibus-keypress is known to fail in a Wayland based desktop environment. The test named xkb-latin-layouts is known to fail with a recent xkeyboard-config release. The test named test-override-ibus.py is known to fail if Python support library is enabled.

Now, as the `root` user:

**Note: This command is missing a pair of braces, /usr/share/man/man{... gz}, starting after man until the last character of the command is enclosed!**

```bash
make install &&
gzip -dfv /usr/share/man/man{1,5}/ibus*.gz,5/00-upstream-settings.5.gz
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--disable-emoji-dict`: This switch disables the use of emoticon dictionaries. Omit if you installed the optional package.

`--disable-unicode-dict`: This switch disables the use of unicode dictionaries. Omit if you installed the optional Unicode Character Database.

**rm -f tools/main.c**: This command removes a generated file that was not removed when packaging.

`--disable-gtk2`: This switch disables building the GTK+ 2 immodule. Use it if you have not installed GTK+ 2.

`--enable-gtk4`: This switch enables building the GTK 4 immodule. Use it if you have installed GTK 4.

`--enable-python-library`: This switch enables building the Python support library. Use it if you have installed the optional dependencies.

`--enable-wayland`: This switch enables building the Wayland support programs. Use it if you have installed the optional dependencies.

`--with-python=python3`: This switch makes the **configure** script look for Python 3. Use it if you want to build the Python 3 support library alongside the Python 2 one.

`--enable-gtk-doc`: Use this parameter if GTK-Doc is installed and you wish to rebuild and install the API documentation.

**gzip -dfv ...**: Decompress installed man pages in accordance with other man pages.

Configuring Ibus
----------------

If GTK+-3 or GTK+-2 are installed and `--disable-gtk{3,2}` are not used, the ibus IM module for GTK+-3 or GTK+-2 will be installed. As the `root` user, update a cache file of GTK+-3 or GTK+-2 so the GTK-based applications can find the newly installed IM module and use ibus as an input method:

```bash
gtk-query-immodules-3.0 --update-cache
```

The command above updates the cache file for GTK+-3. For GTK+-2, use **gtk-query-immodules-2.0** instead of **gtk-query-immodules-3.0**. GTK-4 does not require a cache file for IM modules.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** ibus, ibus-daemon, and ibus-setup

**Installed Library:** libibus-1.0.so and im-ibus.so (GTK+ Immodule)

**Installed Directories:** /etc/dconf/db/ibus.d, /usr/include/ibus-1.0, /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/ibus, and /usr/share/ibus

### Short Descriptions

**ibus-daemon**         is the Intelligent Input Bus Daemon.

**ibus-setup**          is the GTK+ program used to configure the **ibus-daemon**.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/imagemagick](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/imagemagick)

Installation of ImageMagick
---------------------------

Install ImageMagick by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr     \
            --sysconfdir=/etc \
            --enable-hdri     \
            --with-modules    \
            --with-perl       \
            --disable-static  &&
make
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make DOCUMENTATION_PATH=/usr/share/doc/imagemagick-7.1.0 install
```

To test the installation, issue: **make check**. Note that the EPS, PS, and PDF tests require a working Ghostscript. One test in 'make check' needs “Helvetica” from “Ghostscript Standard Fonts”, which are optionally installed in [ghostscript-10.00.0](46.Printing.md#463-ghostscript-10000) - that test, and one other, might fail, but all the validation can still pass.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--enable-hdri`: Enables building of a high dynamic range version of ImageMagick.

`--with-modules`: Enables support for dynamically loadable modules.

`--with-perl`: Enables building and installing of PerlMagick.

`--disable-static`: This switch prevents installation of static versions of the libraries.

`--with-gslib`: Enables support to use the Ghostscript shared library.

`--with-rsvg`: Enables support to use the librsvg library.

`--with-autotrace`: Enables support to use the Autotrace library.

`--with-wmf`: Enables support to use the libwmf library.

`--with-gvc`: Enables support to use GraphViz.

`--with-windows-font-dir= <Some/Directory>`: This option specifies the directory where the Windows CoreFonts are installed.

`--with-dejavu-font-dir= <Some/Directory>`: This option specifies the directory where the DejaVu fonts are installed.

The options and parameters listed above are the only ones you should have to pass to the **configure** script to activate all the delegate dependencies. All other dependencies will be automatically detected and utilized in the build if they are installed.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lsof](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lsof)

Kernel Configuration
--------------------

To run the tests, the following option should be enabled in the kernel configuration:

```bash
General setup  --->
    [*] POSIX Message Queues    [CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE]
```

Installation of lsof
--------------------

Install lsof by running the following commands:

```bash
install -v -m4755 -o root -g root lsof /usr/bin &&
install -v lsof.8 /usr/share/man/man8
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**./Configure -n linux**: Avoid AFS, customization, and inventory checks, and use the linux dialect.

**install -m4755 ...**: **lsof** should be suid root to allow users to list all files. This may be a security threat on some systems. In that case change to `-m755` and use **sudo** to run the program.

Configuring unixODBC
--------------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/unixODBC/*`

#### Configuration Information

The files in `/etc/unixODBC` are meant to be configured by the system administrator (or the ODBC site administrator if appropriate privileges are granted to `/etc/unixODBC`). These files are not meant to be directly edited. The ODBC installer library is responsible for reading and writing the unixODBC config files.

Unfortunately, there are not many **man**, or any **info** pages for the various programs available in the unixODBC package. Along with the information in the “Short Descriptions” below and the documentation installed in `/usr/share/doc/unixODBC-2.3.11`, there are many `README` files throughout the source tree where the use and functionality of the programs can be found. Additionally, you can use the parameter `-?` for syntax and usage information. Lastly, the unixODBC web site at [http://www.unixodbc.org/](http://www.unixodbc.org/) has very good information.

### Short Descriptions

**dltest**              is a utility used to check a shared library to see if it can be loaded and if a given symbol exists in it.

**isql**                is a utility which can be used to submit SQL to a data source and to format/output results. It can be used in batch or interactive mode.

**iusql**               provides the same functionality as the **isql** program.

**odbc_config**         is used to find out details about the installation of the unixODBC package.

**odbcinst**            is a utility created for install script/RPM writers. It is a command line interface to key functionality in the `libodbcinst` library. It does not copy any files (i.e., libraries) but it will modify the ODBC System Information for the user.

**slencheck**           is a utility which attempts to check whether an ODBC driver was built with 32-bit or 64-bit SQLLEN types.
