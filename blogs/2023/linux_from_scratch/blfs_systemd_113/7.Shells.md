# 7. Shells
--------

We are all familiar with the Bourne Again SHell, but there are two other user interfaces that are considered useful modern shells – the Berkeley Unix C shell and the Korn shell. This chapter installs packages compatible with these additional shell types.


## 7.1 Dash-0.5.12
--------

Introduction to Dash
--------------------

Dash is a POSIX compliant shell. It can be installed as /bin/sh or as the default shell for either `root` or a second user with a userid of 0. It depends on fewer libraries than the Bash shell and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade problem or disk failure. Dash is also useful for checking that a script is completely compatible with POSIX syntax.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/dash](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/dash)

Installation of Dash
--------------------

Install Dash by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --bindir=/bin --mandir=/usr/share/man &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

If you would like to make **dash** the default **sh**, recreate the `/bin/sh` symlink as the `root` user:

### Note

If you create the symbolic link from **dash** to **sh**, you will need to reset the link to **bash** to build LFS.

```bash
ln -svf dash /bin/sh
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--bindir=/bin`: This parameter places the **dash** binary into the root filesystem.

`--with-libedit`: To compile Dash with libedit support.

Configuring Dash
----------------

### 

#### Config Files

Dash sources `/etc/profile` and `~/.profile`

#### Configuration Information

Update `/etc/shells` to include the Dash shell by issuing the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
cat >> /etc/shells << "EOF"
/bin/dash
EOF
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Program:** dash

**Installed Libraries:** None

**Installed Directories:** None

### Short Description

**dash**                is a POSIX compliant shell.


## 7.2 Tcsh-6.24.07
--------

Introduction to Tcsh
--------------------

The Tcsh package contains “an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley Unix C shell (**csh**)”. This is useful as an alternative shell for those who prefer C syntax to that of the **bash** shell, and also because some programs require the C shell in order to perform installation tasks.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tcsh](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tcsh)

Installation of Tcsh
--------------------

Install Tcsh by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install install.man &&

ln -v -sf tcsh   /bin/csh &&
ln -v -sf tcsh.1 /usr/share/man/man1/csh.1
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**ln -v -sf tcsh /bin/csh**: The FHS states that if there is a C shell installed, there should be a symlink from `/bin/csh` to it. This creates that symlink.

Configuring Tcsh
----------------

### 

#### Config Files

There are numerous configuration files for the C shell. Examples of these are `/etc/csh.cshrc`, `/etc/csh.login`, `/etc/csh.logout`, `~/.tcshrc`, `~/.cshrc`, `~/.history`, `~/.cshdirs`, `~/.login`, and `~/.logout`. More information on these files can be found in the `tcsh(1)` man page.

#### Configuration Information

Update `/etc/shells` to include the C shell program names (as the `root` user):

```bash
cat >> /etc/shells << "EOF"
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
EOF
```

The following `~/.cshrc` provides two alternative colour prompts and coloured **ls** output. If you prefer a global modification, issue the command as the `root` user, replacing `~/.cshrc` by `/etc/csh.cshrc`.

```bash
cat > ~/.cshrc << "EOF"
# Original at:
# https://www.cs.umd.edu/~srhuang/teaching/code_snippets/prompt_color.tcsh.html

# Modified by the BLFS Development Team.

# Add these lines to your ~/.cshrc (or to /etc/csh.cshrc).

# Colors!
set     red="%{\033[1;31m%}"
set   green="%{\033[0;32m%}"
set  yellow="%{\033[1;33m%}"
set    blue="%{\033[1;34m%}"
set magenta="%{\033[1;35m%}"
set    cyan="%{\033[1;36m%}"
set   white="%{\033[0;37m%}"
set     end="%{\033[0m%}" # This is needed at the end...

# Setting the actual prompt.  Two separate versions for you to try, pick
# whichever one you like better, and change the colors as you want.
# Just don't mess with the ${end} guy in either line...  Comment out or
# delete the prompt you don't use.

set prompt="${green}%n${blue}@%m ${white}%~ ${green}%%${end} "
set prompt="[${green}%n${blue}@%m ${white}%~ ]${end} "

# This was not in the original URL above
# Provides coloured ls
alias ls ls --color=always

# Clean up after ourselves...
unset red green yellow blue magenta cyan yellow white end
EOF
```

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/zsh](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/zsh)

Installation of zsh
-------------------

If you downloaded the optional documentation, unpack it with the following command:

```bash
tar --strip-components=1 -xvf ../zsh-5.9-doc.tar.xz
```

Install zsh by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr            \
            --sysconfdir=/etc/zsh    \
            --enable-etcdir=/etc/zsh \
            --enable-cap             \
            --enable-gdbm                             &&
make                                                  &&

makeinfo  Doc/zsh.texi --plaintext -o Doc/zsh.txt     &&
makeinfo  Doc/zsh.texi --html      -o Doc/html        &&
makeinfo  Doc/zsh.texi --html --no-split --no-headers -o Doc/zsh.html
```

If you have [texlive-20220321](51.Typesetting.md#513-texlive-20220321-source) installed, you can build PDF format of the documentation by issuing the following command:

```bash
texi2pdf  Doc/zsh.texi -o Doc/zsh.pdf
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install                              &&
make infodir=/usr/share/info install.info &&

install -v -m755 -d                 /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9/html &&
install -v -m644 Doc/html/*         /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9/html &&
install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.{html,txt} /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9
```

If you downloaded the optional documentation, install it by issuing the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
make htmldir=/usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9/html install.html &&
install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.dvi /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9
```

If you built the PDF format of the documentation, install it by issuing the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
install -v -m644 Doc/zsh.pdf /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--sysconfdir=/etc/zsh` and `--enable-etcdir=/etc/zsh`: These parameters are used so that all the zsh configuration files are consolidated into the `/etc/zsh` directory. Omit these parameters if you wish to retain historical compatibility by having all the files located in the `/etc` directory.

`--enable-cap`: This option enables POSIX capabilities.

`--enable-gdbm`: This option enables the use of the GDBM library.

`--enable-pcre`: This option allows zsh to use the PCRE regular expression library in shell builtins.

Configuring zsh
---------------

#### Config Files

There are a whole host of configuration files for zsh including `/etc/zsh/zshenv`, `/etc/zsh/zprofile`, `/etc/zsh/zshrc`, `/etc/zsh/zlogin` and `/etc/zsh/zlogout`. You can find more information on these in the `zsh(1)` and related manual pages.

The first time zsh is executed, you will be prompted by messages asking several questions. The answers will be used to create a `~/.zshrc` file. If you wish to run these questions again, run **zsh /usr/share/zsh/5.9/functions/zsh-newuser-install -f**.

There are several built-in advanced prompts. In the **zsh** shell, start advanced prompt support with **autoload -U promptinit**, then **promptinit**. Available prompt names are listed with **prompt -l**. Select a particular one with **prompt `<prompt-name>`**. Display all available prompts with **prompt -p**. Except for the list and display commands above, you can insert the other ones in `~/.zshrc` to be automatically executed at shell start, with the prompt you chose.

#### Configuration Information

Update `/etc/shells` to include the zsh shell program names (as the `root` user):

```bash
cat >> /etc/shells << "EOF"
/bin/zsh
EOF
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** zsh and zsh-5.9 (hardlinked to each other)

**Installed Libraries:** Numerous plugin helper modules under /usr/lib/zsh/5.9/

**Installed Directories:** /usr/{lib,share}/zsh and /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9

### Short Description

**zsh**                 is a shell which has command-line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.
