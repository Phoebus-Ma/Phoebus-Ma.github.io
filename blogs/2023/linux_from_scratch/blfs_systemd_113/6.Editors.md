User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/bluefish](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/bluefish)

Installation of Bluefish
------------------------

Install Bluefish by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr --docdir=/usr/share/doc/bluefish-2.2.12 &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

### Note

This package installs icon files into the `/usr/share/icons/hicolor` hierarchy and desktop files into the `/usr/share/applications` hierarchy. You can improve system performance and memory usage by updating `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache` and `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache`. To perform the update you must have [desktop-file-utils-0.26](11.General_utilities.md#114-desktop-file-utils-026) (for the desktop cache) and issue the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
gtk-update-icon-cache -t -f --include-image-data /usr/share/icons/hicolor &&

## 6.2 Ed-1.19
--------

Introduction to Ed
------------------

Ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via shell scripts. Ed isn't something which many people use. It's described here because it can be used by the patch program if you encounter an ed-based patch file. This happens rarely because diff-based patches are preferred these days.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

```

Check the `sample.nanorc` file in the installed documentation directory. It includes color configurations and has some documentation included in the comments.

Syntax highlighting is provided for several file types, in `/usr/share/nano/` directory. E.g., for shell scripts, you can insert `include /usr/share/nano/sh.nanorc` in the personal or global configuration file. If you wish highlighting for all supported files, use `include /usr/share/nano/*.nanorc`. This include does not descend into the `extra` directory. Move required files one level up.

### Short Descriptions

**nano**                is a small, simple text editor which aims to replace Pico, the default editor in the Pine package

## 6.9 Vim-9.0.1273
--------

Introduction to Vim
-------------------

The Vim package, which is an abbreviation for VI IMproved, contains a **vi** clone with extra features as compared to the original **vi**.

The default LFS instructions install vim as a part of the base system. If you would prefer to link vim against X, you should recompile vim to enable GUI mode. There is no need for special instructions since X support is automatically detected.

### Note

The version of vim changes daily. To get the latest version, go to [https://github.com/vim/vim/releases](https://github.com/vim/vim/releases).

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

Installation of Vim
-------------------

### Note

If you recompile Vim to link against X and your X libraries are not on the root partition, you will no longer have an editor for use in emergencies. You may choose to install an additional editor, not link Vim against X, or move the current **vim** executable to the `/bin` directory under a different name such as `vi`.

Install Vim by running the following commands:

### Note

If you intend to run the tests and have not installed Xorg in /usr, append LDFLAGS='-L$XORG_PREFIX/lib' to the configure line below.

```bash
echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE  "/etc/vimrc"' >>  src/feature.h &&
echo '#define SYS_GVIMRC_FILE "/etc/gvimrc"' >> src/feature.h &&

./configure --prefix=/usr        \
            --with-features=huge \
            --enable-gui=gtk3    \
            --with-tlib=ncursesw &&
make
```

### Note

If the global configuration file `/etc/vimrc` references the `VIMRUNTIME` environment variable, some tests may complain about being unable to find the corresponding directory and wait for user input. If this is the case, this file should be saved and removed before running the tests.

To test the results, issue: **make -j1 test**. Even if one of the tests fails to produce the file `test.out` in `src/testdir`, the remaining tests will still be executed. If all goes well, the log will report `ALL DONE`. Some tests labelled as “flaky” may fail occasionally and can be ignored. The tests are known to fail if the output is redirected to a file, and also if they are run in a 'screen' session.

### Note

Some color tests expect to be executed under the **xterm** terminal emulator.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

By default, Vim's documentation is installed in `/usr/share/vim`. The following symlink allows the documentation to be accessed via `/usr/share/doc/vim-9.0.1273`, making it consistent with the location of documentation for other packages:

```bash
ln -snfv ../vim/vim90/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-9.0.1273
```

If you wish to update the runtime files, issue the following command (requires [rsync-3.2.7](15.Networking_programs.md#159-rsync-327)):

```bash
rsync -avzcP --exclude="/dos/" --exclude="/spell/" \
    ftp.nluug.nl::Vim/runtime/ ./runtime/
```

To install the runtime files and regenerate the `tags` file, as the `root` user issue:

```bash
make -C src installruntime &&
vim -c ":helptags /usr/share/doc/vim-9.0.1273" -c ":q"
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--with-features=huge`: This switch enables all the additional features available in Vim, including support for multibyte characters.

`--with-tlib=ncursesw`: This switch forces Vim to link against the `libncursesw` library.

`--enable-gui=no`: This will prevent compilation of the GUI. Vim will still link against X, so that some features such as the client-server model or the x11-selection (clipboard) are still available.

`--without-x`: If you prefer not to link Vim against X, use this switch.

`--enable-luainterp`, `--enable-perlinterp`, `--enable-python3interp=dynamic`, `--enable-tclinterp --with-tclsh=tclsh`, `--enable-rubyinterp`: These options include the Lua, Perl, Python3, Tcl, or Ruby interpreters that allow using other application code in vim scripts. All the `--enable-...` options can accept `=dynamic` to dynamically load the interpreter when needed. This is required for Python 3 to prevent segmentation faults. For tcl, it is necessary to indicate the name of the **tclsh** executable, since **configure** only searches versioned names with old versions.

Configuring Vim
---------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/vimrc` and `~/.vimrc`

### 

#### Configuration Information

Vim has an integrated spell checker which you can enable by issuing the following in a vim window:

```bash
:setlocal spell spelllang=ru
```

This setting will enable spell checking for the Russian language for the current session.

By default, Vim only installs spell files for the English language. If a spell file is not available for a language, then Vim will call the `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin/spellfile.vim` plugin and will try to obtain the *.spl and optionally *.sug from the vim ftp server, by using the `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim` plugin.

Alternatively you can manually download the *.spl and *.sug files from: [ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/) and save them to `~/.vim/spell` or in `/usr/share/vim/vim90/spell/`.

To find out what's new in Vim-9.0.1273 issue the following command:

```bash
:help version-9.0.1273
```
