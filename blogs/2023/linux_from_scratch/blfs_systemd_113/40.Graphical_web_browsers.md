--------

This chapter contains a wonderful selection of browsers. We hope you can find one you enjoy using or give them each a trial run.


## 40.1 Epiphany-43.1
--------

Introduction to Epiphany
------------------------

Epiphany is a simple yet powerful GNOME web browser targeted at non-technical users. Its principles are simplicity and standards compliance.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/epiphany](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/epiphany)

Installation of Epiphany
------------------------

Install Epiphany by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

meson --prefix=/usr --buildtype=release .. &&
ninja
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
ninja install
```

### Note

If you installed the package to your system using a “DESTDIR” method, `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled` was not updated/created. Create (or update) the file using the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
```

One test would fail if this package is not installed, so it's better to run the test suite after installation. To test the results, issue **LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ninja test**. The tests must be run from a graphical session.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--buildtype=release`: Specify a buildtype suitable for stable releases of the package, as the default may produce unoptimized binaries.

Contents
--------

**Installed Program:** epiphany

**Installed Libraries:** None

**Installed Directories:** /usr/{lib,libexec,share,share/help/*}/epiphany

### Short Descriptions

**epiphany**            is a GNOME web browser based on the WebKit2 rendering engine.


## 40.2 Falkon-22.12.2
--------

Introduction to falkon
----------------------

Falkon is a KDE web browser using the QtWebEngine rendering engine. It was previously known as QupZilla. It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms.

Although falkon is now part of KDE, it can be installed without KDE (with the loss of kwallet functionality).

### Warning

Falkon relies on QtWebEngine. That uses a forked copy of chromium, and is therefore vulnerable to many issues found there. The Qt developers have always preferred to make releases at the same time as the rest of Qt (rather than adding emergency fixes). Now that they are keen to move to Qt6, the 5.15.3 and later Qt-5.15 releases are initially only available to paying customers. QtWebEngine is something of an exception because of its LGPL licence, but getting the git sources (with the forked chromium submodule) to a point where they will successfully build on a current BLFS system can take a lot of effort. Be aware that future fixes for vulnerabilities might be very delayed, to the extent that you might wish to consider using a different browser.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### falkon Dependencies

#### Required

[extra-cmake-modules-5.103.0](29.Introduction_to_kde.md#292-extra-cmake-modules-51030), [KDE Frameworks-5.103.0](30.KDE_frameworks_5.md#302-building-kde-frameworks-5-kf5) (for karchive), and [qtwebengine-5.15.12](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2545-qtwebengine-51512)

### Note

Strictly speaking, only karchive is required to build falkon, but several other packages in KF5 can be used if they are present. To build only karchive, download that package from the directory specified in [KDE Frameworks-5.103.0](30.KDE_frameworks_5.md#302-building-kde-frameworks-5-kf5) and use the build instructions on that page changing the $KF5_PREFIX to /usr.

#### Optional

[gnome-keyring-42.1](33.GNOME_libraries_and_desktop.md#3336-gnome-keyring-421), [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/), and [Shiboken2](https://pypi.org/project/shiboken2/)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/falkon](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/falkon)

Installation of falkon
----------------------

Install falkon by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
      .. &&

make
```

To test the results, issue: **make test**. All tests should pass. If any fail, the full results will be in `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

If you have installed Pyside2 you will want to examine **hellopython.py** which is in the `scripts/` directory, and perhaps copy it to your home directory.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`: This will save a little time and space by not building the test programs, use this if you do not wish to run the test.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** falkon

**Installed Library:** libFalkonPrivate.so.3

**Installed Directory:** /usr/share/falkon

### Short Descriptions

**falkon**              is a web browser which uses qtwebengine.

`libFalkonPrivate.so.3` contains functions used by falkon.


## 40.3 Firefox-102.8.0esr
--------

Introduction to Firefox
-----------------------

Firefox is a stand-alone browser based on the Mozilla codebase.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Package Information

*   Download (HTTP): [https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/102.8.0esr/source/firefox-102.8.0esr.source.tar.xz](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/102.8.0esr/source/firefox-102.8.0esr.source.tar.xz)
    
*   Download MD5 sum: 2f65e84943e97f6d56d7b07aa1ded135
    
*   Download size: 457 MB
    
*   Estimated disk space required: 7.0 GB (197 MB installed) without tests
    
*   Estimated build time: 20 SBU using -j4, without tests

### Note

The directory name is firefox-102.8.0

Extracting the tarball will reset the permissions of the current directory to 0755 if you have permission to do that. If you do this in a directory where the sticky bit is set, such as `/tmp` it will end with error messages:

tar: .: Cannot utime: Operation not permitted  
tar: .: Cannot change mode to rwxr-xr-t: Operation not permitted  
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors  

This does finish with non-zero status, but it does NOT mean there is a real problem. Do not untar as the `root` user in a directory where the sticky bit is set - that will unset it.

As with other large packages which use C++ (or rust), the SBU times to build this vary more widely than you might expect. The build times will increase significantly if your machine has to swap.

Although upstream prefer to use PulseAudio, for the moment Alsa can still be used. Both may need runtime configuration to get sound working.

### Firefox Dependencies

Installation of Firefox
-----------------------

The configuration of Firefox is accomplished by creating a `mozconfig` file containing the desired configuration options. A default `mozconfig` is created below. To see the entire list of available configuration options (and an abbreviated description of some of them), issue **./mach configure && ./configure --help | less**. You may also wish to review the entire file and uncomment any other desired options. Create the file by issuing the following command:

```bash
cat > mozconfig << "EOF"
# If you have a multicore machine, all cores will be used by default.

# If you have installed (or will install) wireless-tools, and you wish
# to use geolocation web services, comment out this line
ac_add_options --disable-necko-wifi

# API Keys for geolocation APIs - necko-wifi (above) is required for MLS
# Uncomment the following line if you wish to use Mozilla Location Service
#ac_add_options --with-mozilla-api-keyfile=$PWD/mozilla-key

# Uncomment the following line if you wish to use Google's geolocation API
# (needed for use with saved maps with Google Maps)
#ac_add_options --with-google-location-service-api-keyfile=$PWD/google-key

# startup-notification is required since firefox-78

# Uncomment the following option if you have not installed PulseAudio and
# want to use alsa instead
#ac_add_options --enable-audio-backends=alsa

# Comment out following options if you have not installed
# recommended dependencies:
ac_add_options --with-system-icu
ac_add_options --with-system-libevent
ac_add_options --with-system-libvpx
ac_add_options --with-system-nspr
ac_add_options --with-system-nss
ac_add_options --with-system-webp

# Unlike with thunderbird, although using the gold linker can
# save four megabytes in the installed file it does not make
# the build faster.

# libdavid (av1 decoder) requires nasm. Uncomment this if nasm
# has not been installed. Do not uncomment this if you have
# ffmpeg-5 installed.
#ac_add_options --disable-av1

# You cannot distribute the binary if you do this
ac_add_options --enable-official-branding

# Stripping is now enabled by default.
# Uncomment these lines if you need to run a debugger:
#ac_add_options --disable-strip
#ac_add_options --disable-install-strip

# Disabling debug symbols makes the build much smaller and a little
# faster. Comment this if you need to run a debugger. Note: This is
# required for compilation on i686.
ac_add_options --disable-debug-symbols

# The elf-hack is reported to cause failed installs (after successful builds)
# on some machines. It is supposed to improve startup time and it shrinks
# libxul.so by a few MB - comment this if you know your machine is not affected.
ac_add_options --disable-elf-hack

# The BLFS editors recommend not changing anything below this line:
ac_add_options --prefix=/usr
ac_add_options --enable-application=browser
ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter
ac_add_options --disable-updater
# enabling the tests will use a lot more space and significantly
# increase the build time, for no obvious benefit.
ac_add_options --disable-tests

# The default level of optimization again produces a working build with gcc.
ac_add_options --enable-optimize

ac_add_options --enable-system-ffi
ac_add_options --enable-system-pixman

ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg
ac_add_options --with-system-png
ac_add_options --with-system-zlib

# Using sandboxed wasm libraries has been moved to all builds instead
# of only mozilla automation builds. It requires extra llvm packages
# and was reported to seriously slow the build. Disable it.
ac_add_options --without-wasm-sandboxed-libraries

# The following option unsets Telemetry Reporting. With the Addons Fiasco,
# Mozilla was found to be collecting user's data, including saved passwords and
# web form data, without users consent. Mozilla was also found shipping updates
# to systems without the user's knowledge or permission.
# As a result of this, use the following command to permanently disable
# telemetry reporting in Firefox.
unset MOZ_TELEMETRY_REPORTING

mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/firefox-build-dir
EOF
```

Compile Firefox by issuing the following commands:

A change in cbindgen-0.24.2 causes a symbol to now be output by cbindgen, but it has already been defined in a header. This sed prevents the build from eventually failing:

```bash
sed -i '/ROOT_CLIP_CHAIN/d' gfx/webrender_bindings/webrender_ffi.h
```

If the geolocation APIs are needed:

### Note

The Google and Mozilla API Keys below are specific to LFS. If using these instructions for another distro, or if you intend to distribute binary copies of the software using these instructions, please obtain your own keys following the instructions located at [https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys) and [https://location.services.mozilla.com/api](https://location.services.mozilla.com/api) respectively.

```bash
echo "AIzaSyDxKL42zsPjbke5O8_rPVpVrLrJ8aeE9rQ" > google-key
echo "613364a7-9418-4c86-bcee-57e32fd70c23" > mozilla-key
```

### Note

If you are compiling this package in chroot you must do two things. First, as the `root` user, ensure that `/dev/shm` is mounted. If you do not do this, the Python configuration will fail with a traceback report referencing `/usr/lib/pythonN.N/multiprocessing/synchronize.py`. Run:

```bash
mountpoint -q /dev/shm || mount -t tmpfs devshm /dev/shm
```

Second, either as the `root` user export the `$SHELL` environment variable using **export SHELL=/bin/sh** or else prepend `SHELL=/bin/sh` when running the **./mach** commands.

Now invoke the Python **mach** script to compile the package.

```bash
export MACH_BUILD_PYTHON_NATIVE_PACKAGE_SOURCE=none &&
export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH=${PWD}/mozbuild          &&
./mach configure                                    &&
./mach build
```

The `mozconfig` above disables the tests because they use a lot more time and disk space for no obvious benefit. If you have nevertheless enabled them, you can run the tests by executing **./mach gtest**. This will require a network connection, and to be run from within an Xorg session - there is a popup dialog when it fails to connect to ALSA (that does not create a failed test). One or two tests will fail. To see the details of the failure(s) you will need to log the output from that command so that you can review it.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
MACH_BUILD_PYTHON_NATIVE_PACKAGE_SOURCE=none ./mach install
```

Empty the environment variables which were set above:

```bash
unset MACH_BUILD_PYTHON_NATIVE_PACKAGE_SOURCE MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH=${PWD}/mozbuild**: The build is now supposed to tell you that it intends to create `~/.mozbuild`, and offer you an option to press <ENTER> to accept this, or Ctrl-C to cancel and restart the build after specifying the directory. In practice, the message may not appear until after <ENTER> is keyed, i.e. the build stalls.

That directory is used for a (probably random) telemetry identifier. Creating this in the build directory, and deleting that after the installation, prevents it being used. If you wish to participate in telemetry, export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH to point to its default directory and remove the entry from the `mozconfig`.

**MACH_BUILD_PYTHON_NATIVE_PACKAGE_SOURCE=none**: Use the system python to create a virtual environment for **mach** without downloading any python wheels nor using the system python modules. This prevent version mismatches between system modules and bundled ones.

**./mach configure**: This validates the supplied dependencies and the `mozconfig`.

`./mach build --verbose`: Use this alternative if you need details of which files are being compiled, together with any C or C++ flags being used. But do not add '--verbose' to the install command since it is not accepted there.

`./mach build -jN`: The build should, by default, use all the online CPU cores. If using all the cores causes the build to swap because you have insufficient memory, using fewer cores can be faster.

`` `CC=gcc CXX=g++` ``: BLFS used to prefer to use gcc and g++ instead of upstream's defaults of the clang programs. With the release of gcc-12 the build takes longer with gcc and g++, primarily because of extra warnings, and is bigger. Set these environment variables before you run the configure script if you wish to continue to use gcc, g++. Building with GCC on i?86 is currently broken.

Configuring Firefox
-------------------

If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may want to create a `firefox.desktop` file so that Firefox appears in the panel's menus. As the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -pv /usr/share/applications &&
mkdir -pv /usr/share/pixmaps      &&

MIMETYPE="text/xml;text/mml;text/html;"                            &&
MIMETYPE+="application/xhtml+xml;application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml;" &&
MIMETYPE+="x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https"           &&

cat > /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop << EOF &&
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Firefox Web Browser
Comment=Browse the World Wide Web
GenericName=Web Browser
Exec=firefox %u
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=firefox
Categories=GNOME;GTK;Network;WebBrowser;
MimeType=$MIMETYPE

EOF

unset MIMETYPE &&

ln -sfv /usr/lib/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default128.png \
        /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png
```

#### Configuration Information

The application settings for firefox are accessible by keying **about:config** in the address bar.

Occasionally, getting working sound in firefox can be a problem. Although upstream prefers pulseaudio, on balance using Alsa may be easier.

If you enabled Alsa for sound, you may need to alter one variable to get working sound. If you run **firefox** from a terminal and try to play something with sound you might encounter error messages like:

`Sandbox: seccomp sandbox violation: pid 3941, tid 4030, syscall 16, args 48 2147767296 139909894784796 0 0 0.`

That was on x86_64, on i686 the syscall number is 54. To allow this syscall, in **about:config** change **security.sandbox.content.syscall_whitelist** to 16 (or 54 if using i686).

If you use **pulseaudio** in a Desktop Environment, it might already be started by that DE. But if it is not, although firefox-57 managed to start it, firefox-58 did not. If you run **firefox** from a terminal and this problem is present, trying to play sound will encounter error messages warning `Can't get cubeb context!`

The fix for this is to close firefox, start pulseaudio to check it does start (if not, read the information on Configuring in [PulseAudio-16.1](42.Multimedia_libraries_and_drivers.md#4248-pulseaudio-161)) and restart firefox to check it is working. If it now works, add the following to your `~/.xinitrc`: `pulseaudio --verbose --log-target=journald&` (unfortunately, on some systems this does not work).

You may wish to use multiple profiles within firefox. To do that, invoke firefox as **firefox --ProfileManager**. You can also check which profile is currently in use from **about:profiles**.

Although WebRender (using the GPU for compositing) is not used by default, it now appears to work well on supported hardware (ATI, Nvidia and Intel GPUs with Mesa-18 or later). For an explanation, please see [hacks.mozilla.org](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/). The only downside seems to be that on a machine with limited RAM it might use more RAM.

To check if WebRender is being used, look in about:support. In the Graphics section, Compositing will either show 'Basic' (i.e. not in use) or 'WebRender'. To enable it, go to about:config and change gfx.webrender.all to True. You will need to restart firefox.

It may be useful to mention the processes from firefox which can appear in **top** - as well as firefox itself, there may be multiple Web Content processes, and now an RDD Process (Remote Data Decoder) which appears when playing web videos encoded with av1 (libdav1d). If WebRender has been enabled, a GPU Process will also appear when firefox has to repaint (e.g. scrolling, opening a new tab, or playing a video).

## 40.4 SeaMonkey-2.53.15
--------

Introduction to SeaMonkey
-------------------------

SeaMonkey is a browser suite, a descendant of Netscape. It includes the browser, composer, mail and news clients, and an IRC client.

It is the community-driven follow-on to the Mozilla Application Suite, created after Mozilla decided to focus on separate applications for browsing and e-mail. Those applications are [Firefox-102.8.0](40.Graphical_web_browsers.md#403-firefox-10280esr) and [Thunderbird-102.8.0](41.Other_x-based_programs.md#4111-thunderbird-10280).

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

Installation of SeaMonkey
-------------------------

The configuration of SeaMonkey is accomplished by creating a `mozconfig` file containing the desired configuration options. A default `mozconfig` file is created below. To see the entire list of available configuration options (and an abbreviated description of each one), issue **./configure --help**. You may also wish to review the entire file and uncomment any other desired options. Create the file by issuing the following command:

```bash
cat > mozconfig << "EOF"
# If you have a multicore machine, all cores will be used

# If you have installed DBus-Glib comment out this line:
ac_add_options --disable-dbus

# If you have installed dbus-glib, and you have installed (or will install)
# wireless-tools, and you wish to use geolocation web services, comment out
# this line
ac_add_options --disable-necko-wifi

# Uncomment these lines if you have installed optional dependencies:
#ac_add_options --enable-system-hunspell
#ac_add_options --enable-startup-notification

# Uncomment the following option if you have not installed PulseAudio
#ac_add_options --disable-pulseaudio
# and uncomment this if you installed alsa-lib instead of PulseAudio
#ac_add_options --enable-alsa

# Comment out following option if you have gconf installed
ac_add_options --disable-gconf

# Comment out following options if you have not installed
# recommended dependencies:
ac_add_options --with-system-icu
ac_add_options --with-system-libevent
ac_add_options --with-system-nspr
ac_add_options --with-system-nss
ac_add_options --with-system-webp

# Disabling debug symbols makes the build much smaller and a little
# faster. Comment this if you need to run a debugger. Note: This is
# required for compilation on i686.
ac_add_options --disable-debug-symbols

# The elf-hack is reported to cause failed installs (after successful builds)
# on some machines. It is supposed to improve startup time and it shrinks
# libxul.so by a few MB - comment this if you know your machine is not affected.
ac_add_options --disable-elf-hack

# Seamonkey has some additional features that are not turned on by default,
# such as an IRC client, calendar, and DOM Inspector. The DOM Inspector
# aids with designing web pages. Comment these options if you do not
# desire these features.
ac_add_options --enable-calendar
ac_add_options --enable-dominspector
ac_add_options --enable-irc

# The BLFS editors recommend not changing anything below this line:
ac_add_options --prefix=/usr
ac_add_options --enable-application=comm/suite

ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter
ac_add_options --disable-updater
ac_add_options --disable-tests

# rust-simd does not compile with recent versions of rust.
# It is disabled in recent versions of firefox
ac_add_options --disable-rust-simd

ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-O2"
ac_add_options --enable-strip
ac_add_options --enable-install-strip
ac_add_options --enable-official-branding

# The option to use system cairo was removed in 2.53.9.
ac_add_options --enable-system-ffi
ac_add_options --enable-system-pixman

ac_add_options --with-system-bz2
ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg
ac_add_options --with-system-png
ac_add_options --with-system-zlib
EOF
```

### Note

If you are compiling this package in chroot you must do two things. First, as the `root` user, ensure that `/dev/shm` is mounted. If you do not do this, the Python configuration will fail with a traceback report referencing `/usr/lib/pythonN.N/multiprocessing/synchronize.py`. Run:

```bash
mountpoint -q /dev/shm || mount -t tmpfs devshm /dev/shm
```

Second, either as the `root` user export the `$SHELL` environment variable using **export SHELL=/bin/sh** or else prepend `SHELL=/bin/sh` when running the **./mach** commands.

First remove an obsolete flag in python code, that has been removed in python-3.11:

```bash
grep -rl \"rU\" | xargs sed -i 's/"rU"/"r"/'
```

Next, work around a problem in the Python virtual environment:

```bash
sed -i "/if sys.executable !=/i\    open(join(bin_dir, 'pyvenv.cfg'), 'w').close()" \
    third_party/python/virtualenv/virtualenv.py
```

Next, work around a crash that occurs when playing audio when Seamonkey is compiled with rustc-1.67 or higher:

```bash
sed -i '/USE_PULSE_RUST/d' media/libcubeb/src/moz.build
```

Compile SeaMonkey by running the following commands:

```bash
export CC=clang CXX=clang++          &&
./mach configure || ./mach configure &&
./mach build
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install SeaMonkey by issuing the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
./mach install                  &&
chown -R 0:0 /usr/lib/seamonkey &&

cp -v $(find -name seamonkey.1 | head -n1) /usr/share/man/man1
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**export CC=clang CXX=clang++**: With the introduction of gcc-12, many more warnings are generated when compiling mozilla applications and that results in a much slower, and larger, build. Furthermore, building with GCC on i?86 is currently broken. Although upstream mozilla code defaults to using llvm unless overridden, the older configure code in SeaMonkey defaults to gcc.

**./mach configure || ./mach configure**: This validates the supplied dependencies and the `mozconfig`. This is run twice because problems with mach will cause it to fail the first time.

`./mach build --verbose`: Use this alternative if you need details of which files are being compiled, together with any C or C++ flags being used. But do not add '--verbose' to the install command, it is not accepted there.

`./mach build -jN`: The build should, by default, use all the online CPU cores. If using all the cores causes the build to swap because you have insufficient memory, using fewer cores can be faster.

Configuring SeaMonkey
---------------------

For installing various SeaMonkey add-ons, refer to [Add-ons for Seamonkey](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/seamonkey/).

Along with using the “Preferences” menu to configure SeaMonkey's options and preferences to suit individual tastes, finer grain control of many options is only available using a tool not available from the general menu system. To access this tool, you'll need to open a browser window and enter `about:config` in the address bar. This will display a list of the configuration preferences and information related to each one. You can use the “Search:” bar to enter search criteria and narrow down the listed items. Changing a preference can be done using two methods. One, if the preference has a boolean value (True/False), simply double-click on the preference to toggle the value and two, for other preferences simply right-click on the desired line, choose “Modify” from the menu and change the value. Creating new preference items is accomplished in the same way, except choose “New” from the menu and provide the desired data into the fields when prompted.

If you use a desktop environment like Gnome or KDE you may wish to create a `seamonkey.desktop` file so that SeaMonkey appears in the panel's menus. If you didn't enable Startup-Notification in your mozconfig change the StartupNotify line to false. As the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -pv /usr/share/{applications,pixmaps}              &&

cat > /usr/share/applications/seamonkey.desktop << "EOF"
