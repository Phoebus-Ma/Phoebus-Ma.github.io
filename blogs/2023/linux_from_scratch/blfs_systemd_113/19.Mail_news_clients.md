# 19. Mail/News Clients
--------

Mail Clients help you retrieve (Fetchmail), sort (Procmail), read and compose responses (Heirloom mailx, Mutt, Pine, Kmail, Balsa, Evolution, SeaMonkey) to email.

News clients also help you retrieve, sort, read and compose responses, but these messages travel through USENET (a worldwide bulletin board system) using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP).


## 19.1 Fetchmail-6.4.36
--------

Introduction to Fetchmail
-------------------------

The Fetchmail package contains a mail retrieval program. It retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it to the local (client) machine's delivery system, so it can then be read by normal mail user agents.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Fetchmail Dependencies

#### Recommended

a local MDA ([Procmail-3.22](19.Mail_news_clients.md#194-procmail-322))

#### Optional

[MIT Kerberos V5-1.20.1](4.Security.md#415-mit-kerberos-v5-1201) and [libgssapi](http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/linux/)

#### Optional (for running fetchmailconf)

[Python-3.11.2](13.Programming.md#1323-python-3112), built after [Tk-8.6.13](13.Programming.md#1334-tk-8613), with the [py-future](https://python-future.org/) package

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fetchmail](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/fetchmail)

Installation of Fetchmail
-------------------------

Create a dedicated user for the fetchmail program. Issue the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
useradd -c "Fetchmail User" -d /dev/null -g nogroup \
        -s /bin/false -u 38 fetchmail
```

Install Fetchmail by running the following commands:

```bash
PYTHON=python3 \
./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --enable-fallback=procmail &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install                                  &&
chown -v fetchmail:nogroup /usr/bin/fetchmail
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`PYTHON=python3`: a version of Python is _required_, but only used to install a module to allow fetchmailconf to be run. That module is unmaintained and should not be used.

`--enable-fallback=procmail`: This tells Fetchmail to hand incoming mail to Procmail for delivery, if the port 25 mail server is not present or not responding.

Configuring Fetchmail
---------------------

#### Config Files

`~/.fetchmailrc`

#### Configuration Information

### Note

If you are connecting to a mailserver that supports SSL/TLS-wrapped or "implicit" mode on a dedicated port (default 993) you should use **fetchmail --ssl** or add the option 'ssl' in an rcfile.

```bash
cat > ~/.fetchmailrc << "EOF"

# The logfile needs to exist when fetchmail is invoked, otherwise it will
# dump the details to the screen. As with all logs, you will need to rotate
# or clear it from time to time.
set logfile fetchmail.log
set no bouncemail
# You probably want to set your local username as the postmaster
set postmaster <username>

poll SERVERNAME :
    user <isp_username> pass <password>;
    mda "/usr/bin/procmail -f %F -d %T";
EOF

touch ~/fetchmail.log       &&
chmod -v 0600 ~/.fetchmailrc
```

This is an example configuration that should suffice for most people. You can add as many users and servers as you need using the same syntax.

**man fetchmail**: Look for the section near the bottom named _CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES_. It gives some quick examples. There are countless other configuration options once you get used to it.

If you expect to receive very little mail you can invoke fetchmail when you wish to receive any incoming mail. More commonly, it is either invoked in daemon mode with the `-d` option either on the command line, or in `.fetchmailrc` (see 'DAEMON MODE' in man fetchmailconf), or alternatively it is invoked from a cron job.

Contents

**Installed Programs:** fetchmail and fetchmailconf

**Installed Libraries:** None

**Installed Directories:** None

### Short Descriptions

**fetchmail**           when executed as a user, this will source `~/.fetchmailrc` and download the appropriate mail

**fetchmailconf**       is intended to assist you in setting up and editing a `~/.fetchmailrc` configuration file, by using a Tk GUI interface. It is written for Python and the Tkinter module but is labelled with a WARNING that it needs to be updated for fetchmail 6.4's SSL options and other recent new options.


## 19.2 mailx-12.5
--------

Introduction to Heirloom mailx
------------------------------

The Heirloom mailx package (formerly known as the Nail package) contains **mailx**, a command-line Mail User Agent derived from Berkeley Mail. It is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX **mailx** command with additional support for MIME messages, IMAP (including caching), POP3, SMTP, S/MIME, message threading/sorting, scoring, and filtering. Heirloom mailx is especially useful for writing scripts and batch processing.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mailx](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mailx)

Installation of Heirloom mailx
------------------------------

### Note

This package does not support parallel build.

Install Heirloom mailx by running the following commands.

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../heirloom-mailx-12.5-fixes-1.patch &&

sed 's@<openssl@<openssl-1.0/openssl@' \
    -i openssl.c fio.c makeconfig      &&

make -j1 LDFLAGS+="-L /usr/lib/openssl/" \
         SENDMAIL=/usr/sbin/sendmail
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make PREFIX=/usr UCBINSTALL=/usr/bin/install install &&

ln -v -sf mailx /usr/bin/mail &&
ln -v -sf mailx /usr/bin/nail &&

install -v -m755 -d     /usr/share/doc/heirloom-mailx-12.5 &&
install -v -m644 README /usr/share/doc/heirloom-mailx-12.5
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**make SENDMAIL=/usr/sbin/sendmail**: This changes the default MTA path of **/usr/lib/sendmail**.

**make PREFIX=/usr UCBINSTALL=/usr/bin/install install**: This changes the default installation path of `/usr/local` and the default **install** command path of `/usr/ucb`.

Configuring Heirloom mailx
--------------------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/nail.rc` and `~/.mailrc`

#### Configuration Information

For displaying mails, mailx uses a pager program. Since the default of **pg** is not available on a LFS system, its required to specify which pager is to use. By default, there is **more** and the more comfortable **less** installed. If the variable PAGER is not set in `/etc/profile` or `~/.bash_profile`, or if it should be another pager just for reading mails, it can be set system wide in `/etc/nail.rc`:

```bash
echo "set PAGER=<more|less>" >> /etc/nail.rc
```

or individually for the actual user in `~/.mailrc`:

```bash
echo "set PAGER=<more|less>" >> ~/.mailrc
```

Other interesting options to set in the config files might be EDITOR and MAILDIR.

If not set in the environment for other packages, the default editor can be set by:

```bash
echo "set EDITOR=<vim|nano|...>" >> /etc/nail.rc
```

Depending on which kind of [MTA](21.Mail_server_software.md) is installed, it might be required to set the MAILDIR variable so mailx is able to find the mails:

```bash
echo "set MAILDIR=Maildir" >> /etc/nail.rc
```

Contents

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mutt](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mutt)

Installation of Mutt
--------------------

### Note

Mutt ships with an HTML version of its manual, but the text version is no longer provided because differences in the formatting from different text browsers compared to the shipped version caused complaints. To get a text file, the following are used in order of preference: lynx with overstriking (backspaces) for emphasis, w3m or elinks: the latter two apparently provide plain text. Plain text is generally preferred unless reading the HTML manual, so the instructions below use lynx if available, or else links to produce plain text.

Mutt requires a group named `mail`. You can add this group, if it does not exist, with this command:

```bash
groupadd -g 34 mail
```

If you did not install an [MTA](21.Mail_server_software.md), you need to modify the ownership of `/var/mail` with this command:

```bash
chgrp -v mail /var/mail
```

Install Mutt by running the following commands:

To ensure that a plain text manual is created when using lynx or to otherwise use links to produce it (instead of elinks), run the following command:

```bash
sed  -e 's/ -with_backspaces//' \
     -e 's/elinks/links/'       \
     -e 's/-no-numbering -no-references//' \
     -i doc/Makefile.in
```

Now configure and build the application:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr                           \
            --sysconfdir=/etc                       \
            --with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/mutt-2.2.9 \
            --with-ssl                              \
            --enable-external-dotlock               \
            --enable-pop                            \
            --enable-imap                           \
            --enable-hcache                         \
            --enable-sidebar                        &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

### Note

If you used a DESTDIR method to only install to a temporary location as a regular user (as part of a package management process), you will need to run the following as the `root` user after completing the real install:

```bash
chown root:mail /usr/bin/mutt_dotlock &&
chmod -v 2755 /usr/bin/mutt_dotlock
```

An info file is now installed, so you will also need to recreate the `/usr/share/info/dir` as described when Texinfo was installed in LFS.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`sed ... -e 's/ -with_backspaces//' ...`: This turns off the backspaces used for overstriking when lynx is used, resulting in readable plain text when using **view**.

`sed ... -e 's/elinks/links/' ...`: This allows **links** to be run instead of **elinks** which is not in the book.

`sed ... -e 's/-no-numbering -no-references//' ...`: This removes switches which are not understood by **links**.

`--enable-external-dotlock`: In some circumstances the mutt-dotlock program is not created. This switch ensures it is always created.

`--enable-pop`: This switch enables POP3 support.

`--enable-imap`: This switch enables IMAP support.

`--enable-hcache`: This switch enables header caching.

`--enable-sidebar`: This switch enables support for the sidebar (a list of mailboxes). It is off by default, but can be turned on by **:set sidebar_visible** in mutt (and off again with ':unset'), or it can be enabled in `~/.muttrc`.

`--with-ssl`: This parameter adds SSL/TLS support from openssl in POP3/IMAP/SMTP.

`--enable-autocrypt --with-sqlite3`: These two switches add support for passive protection against data collection, using gnupg and gpgme (gpgme is enabled by autocrypt). See [The Manual](http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#autocryptdoc).

`--enable-gpgme`: This switch enables GPG support through the GPGME package. Use this switch if you want GPG support in Mutt.

`--enable-smtp`: This switch enables SMTP relay support.

`--with-idn2`: Use this parameter if both libidn and libidn2 have been installed, and you wish to use libidn2 here.

`--with-sasl`: This parameter adds authentication support from [Cyrus SASL-2.1.28](4.Security.md#45-cyrus-sasl-2128) in POP3/IMAP/SMTP if they are enabled. Depending on the server configuration, this may not be needed for POP3 or IMAP. However, it is needed for SMTP authentication.

Configuring Mutt
----------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/Muttrc`, `~/.muttrc`, `/etc/mime.types`, and `~/.mime.types`

#### Configuration Information

No changes in these files are necessary to begin using Mutt. When you are ready to make changes, the man page for `muttrc` is a good starting place.

In order to utilize GnuPG, use the following command:

```bash
cat /usr/share/doc/mutt-2.2.9/samples/gpg.rc >> ~/.muttrc
```
