# 13. Programming
--------

A base LFS system can be used as a development platform, however the base system only includes language support for C, C++, Perl, and Python. This chapter provides instructions to build many popular programming environments to greatly expand your system's development capabilities.


## 13.1 Autoconf2.13
--------

Introduction to Autoconf2.13
----------------------------

Autoconf2.13 is an old version of Autoconf . This old version accepts switches which are not valid in more recent versions. Now that firefox has started to use python2 for configuring, this old version is required even if configure files have not been changed.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/autoconf213](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/autoconf213)

Installation of Autoconf2.13
----------------------------

Install Autoconf by running the following commands:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../autoconf-2.13-consolidated_fixes-1.patch &&
mv -v autoconf.texi autoconf213.texi                      &&
rm -v autoconf.info                                       &&
./configure --prefix=/usr --program-suffix=2.13           &&
make
```

To test the installation issue **make check** (all 253 tests should pass).

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install                                      &&
install -v -m644 autoconf213.info /usr/share/info &&
install-info --info-dir=/usr/share/info autoconf213.info
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**mv -v autoconf.texi autoconf213.texi**: ensure that the info file added by this package will not overwrite the more recent version.

**rm -v autoconf.info**: ensure that the info file will be created by the current version of texinfo.

**--program-suffix=2.13**: ensure that the installed programs have the version added to their names, so that only a script which specifically looks for these old versions will find them.

**install -v -m644 ...**: the patch removes install-info from the Makefile because that would install (and if necessary recreate) standards.info which is an old version, so now `autoconf213.info` has to be manually installed.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** autoconf2.13, autoheader2.13, autoreconf2.13, autoscan2.13, autoupdate2.13, and ifnames2.13

**Installed Library:** None

**Installed Directory:** /usr/share/autoconf-2.13

### Short Descriptions

**autoconf2.13**        Produces shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Unix-like systems.

**autoheader2.13**      is a tool for creating template files of C #define statements for configure to use.

**autoreconf2.13**      This automatically runs **autoconf2.13**, **autoheader2.13**, **aclocal**, **automake**, **gettextize** and **libtoolize** in the right order when changes have been made to **autoconf** or **automake** template files.

**autoscan2.13**        Can be used as a preliminary step in creating a `configure.in` file.

**autoupdate2.13**      Modifies a `configure.in` file that still calls **autoconf** macros by their old names to use the current macro names.

**ifnames2.13**         Prints the identifiers that the package uses in C preprocessor conditionals [If a package has already been set up to have some portability, this program can help determine what configure needs to check for. It can also fill in gaps in a configure.in file generated by autoscan].


## 13.2 Cbindgen-0.24.3
--------

Install cbindgen by running the following commands:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To test the results, issue: **cargo test**. Three tests in the final suite are known to fail.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
install -Dm755 target/release/cbindgen /usr/bin/
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Program:** cbindgen

### Clisp Dependencies

#### Recommended

[libsigsegv-2.14](9.General_libraries.md#956-libsigsegv-214)

#### Optional

[libnsl-2.0.0](17.Networking_libraries.md#1711-libnsl-200) and [libffcall](https://www.gnu.org/software/libffcall/)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/clisp](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/clisp)

Installation of Clisp
---------------------

### Note

This package does not support parallel build.

If you are building on a 32-bit system, work around a bug in GCC caused by the latest version of binutils:

```bash
case $(uname -m) in
    i?86) export CFLAGS="${CFLAGS:--O2 -g} -falign-functions=4" ;;
esac
```

Remove two tests, which fail for unknown reasons:

```bash
sed -i -e '/socket/d' -e '/"streams"/d' tests/tests.lisp
```

Install Clisp by running the following commands:

If you are building clisp against libffcall, apply the patch to fix a build failure with current readline:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../clisp-2.49-readline7_fixes-1.patch
```

Install Clisp by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

../configure --srcdir=../                       \
             --prefix=/usr                      \
             --docdir=/usr/share/doc/clisp-2.49 \
             --with-libsigsegv-prefix=/usr &&

ulimit -s 16384 &&
make -j1
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**ulimit -s 16384**: this increases the maximum stack size, as recommended by the **configure**.

**--docdir=/usr/share/doc/clisp-2.49**: this ensures the html documentation will go into a versioned directory instead of straight into `/usr/share/html/`.

**--with-libsigsegv-prefix=/usr**: use this to tell **configure** that you have installed libsigsegv in /usr, otherwise it will not be found.

`--with-libffcall-prefix=/usr`: use this to tell **configure** that you have installed the optional libffcall in /usr, otherwise like libsigsegv it will not be found.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** clisp, clisp-link

**Installed Libraries:** various static libraries in `/usr/lib/clisp-2.49/base/`

**Installed Directories:** /usr/lib/clisp-2.49 /usr/share/doc/clisp-2.49 /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp;

### Short Descriptions

**clisp**               is an ANSI Common Lisp compiler, interpreter, and debugger.

**clisp-link**          is used to link an external module to clisp.


## 13.4 CMake-3.25.2
--------

Introduction to CMake
---------------------

The CMake package contains a modern toolset used for generating Makefiles. It is a successor of the auto-generated **configure** script and aims to be platform- and compiler-independent. A significant user of CMake is KDE since version 4.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

*   Estimated build time: 1.6 SBU (add 3.2 SBU for tests, both using parallelism=4)
    

### CMake Dependencies

#### Recommended

[cURL-7.88.1](17.Networking_libraries.md#172-curl-7881), [libarchive-3.6.2](9.General_libraries.md#928-libarchive-362), [libuv-1.44.2](9.General_libraries.md#965-libuv-1442), and [nghttp2-1.52.0](17.Networking_libraries.md#1720-nghttp2-1520)

#### Optional

[GCC-12.2.0](13.Programming.md#136-gcc-1220) (for gfortran), [git-2.39.2](13.Programming.md#139-git-2392) (for use during tests), [Mercurial-6.3.2](13.Programming.md#1316-mercurial-632) (for use during tests), [Qt-5.15.8](25.Graphical_environment_libraries.md#2544-qt-5158) (for the Qt-based GUI), [sphinx-6.1.3](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) (for building documents), [Subversion-1.14.2](13.Programming.md#1330-subversion-1142) (for testing), and [rhash](https://rhash.sourceforge.net/)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/cmake](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/cmake)

Installation of CMake
---------------------

Install CMake by running the following commands:

```bash
sed -i '/"lib64"/s/64//' Modules/GNUInstallDirs.cmake &&

./bootstrap --prefix=/usr        \
            --system-libs        \
            --mandir=/share/man  \
            --no-system-jsoncpp  \
            --no-system-librhash \
            --docdir=/share/doc/cmake-3.25.2 &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 bin/ctest -j`<N>` -O cmake-3.25.2-test.log**, where `<N>` is an integer between 1 and the number of system cores. Setting `LC_ALL` is needed to prevent some test failures when some of the locale variables are set to non English locales. One test, BundleUtilities, is known to fail.

If you want to investigate a problem with a given "problem1-test", use **bin/ctest -R "problem1-test"** and, to omit it, use **bin/ctest -E "problem1-test"**. These options can be used together: **bin/ctest -R "problem1-test" -E "problem2-test"**. Option `-N` can be used to display all available tests, and you can run **bin/ctest** for a sub-set of tests by using separated by spaces names or numbers as options. Option `--help` can be used to show all options.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**sed ... Modules/GNUInstallDirs.cmake**: This command disables applications using cmake from attempting to install files in /usr/lib64/.

`--system-libs`: This switch forces the build system to link against Zlib, Bzip2, cURL, nghttp2, Expat and libarchive installed on the system.

`--no-system-jsoncpp`: This switch removes the JSON-C++ library from the list of system libraries. A bundled version of that library is used instead.

`--no-system-librhash`: This switch removes the librhash library from the list of system libraries used. A bundled version of that library is used instead.

`--no-system-{curl,libarchive,libuv,nghttp2}`: Use the corresponding option in the list for the **bootstrap** if one recommended dependency is not installed. A bundled version of the dependency will be used instead.

`--qt-gui`: This switch enables building the Qt-based GUI for CMake.

`--parallel=`: This switch enables performing the CMake bootstrap with multiple jobs at one time.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** ccmake, cmake, cmake-gui (optional), cpack, and ctest

**Installed Libraries:** None

**Installed Directories:** /usr/share/cmake-3.25 and /usr/share/doc/cmake-3.25.2

### Short Descriptions

**ccmake**              is a curses based interactive frontend to **cmake**.

**cmake**               is the makefile generator.

**cmake-gui**           (optional) is the Qt-based frontend to **cmake**.

**cpack**               is the CMake packaging program.

**ctest**               is a testing utility for cmake-generated build trees.


## 13.5 Doxygen-1.9.6
--------

Introduction to Doxygen
-----------------------

The Doxygen package contains a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Corba IDL and to some extent PHP, C# and D. It is useful for generating HTML documentation and/or an off-line reference manual from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF, PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.

You can also configure Doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. Used along with Graphviz, you can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/doxygen](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/doxygen)

Installation of Doxygen
-----------------------

Install Doxygen by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -v build &&
cd       build &&

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"         \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
      -Wno-dev .. &&

make
```

To test the results, issue: **make tests**.

If you wish to generate the package documentation, you must have Python, TeX Live (for HTML docs) and Ghostscript (for PDF docs) installed, then issue the following command:

```bash
cmake -DDOC_INSTALL_DIR=share/doc/doxygen-1.9.6 -Dbuild_doc=ON .. &&

make docs
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&
install -vm644 ../doc/*.1 /usr/share/man/man1
```

If you have generated the package documentation, then the man pages are automatically installed, and you do not need to run the last **install ...** command.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`-Dbuild_wizard=ON`: Use this switch if Qt5 is installed and you wish to build the GUI front-end.

`-Dbuild_search=ON`: Use this switch if xapian is installed and you wish to build external search tools (**doxysearch.cgi** and **doxyindexer**).

`-Duse_libclang=ON`: Use this switch if llvm with clang are installed, to add support for libclang parsing.

Configuring Doxygen
-------------------

There is no real configuration necessary for the Doxygen package although three additional packages are required if you wish to use extended capabilities. If you need to use the language translation features, you must have [Python-2.7.18](13.Programming.md#1322-python-2718) installed. If you require formulas to create PDF documentation, then you must have [texlive-20220321](51.Typesetting.md#513-texlive-20220321-source) installed. If you require formulas to convert PostScript files to bitmaps, then you must have [ghostscript-10.00.0](46.Printing.md#463-ghostscript-10000) installed.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** doxygen and optionally, doxywizard, doxyindexer and doxysearch.cgi

**Installed Libraries:** None

**Installed Directory:** /usr/share/doc/doxygen-1.9.6

### Short Descriptions

**doxygen**             is a command-line based utility used to generate template configuration files and then generate documentation from these templates. Use **doxygen --help** for an explanation of the command-line parameters.

**doxywizard**          is a GUI front-end for configuring and running **doxygen**.

**doxyindexer**         generates a search index called `doxysearch.db` from one or more search data files produced by **doxygen**. See, e.g. [https://javacc.github.io/javacc/](https://javacc.github.io/javacc/).

**doxysearch.cgi**      is a CGI program to search the data indexed by **doxyindexer**.


## 13.6 GCC-12.2.0
--------

Introduction to GCC
-------------------

The GCC package contains the GNU Compiler Collection. This page describes the installation of compilers for the following languages: C, C++, Fortran, Objective C, Objective C++, and Go. Since C and C++ are installed in LFS, this page is either for upgrading C and C++, or for installing additional compilers.

### Note

Additional languages, among which D and ADA, are available in the collection. D and ADA have a binary bootstrap requirement for the first installation, so their installation is not described here. To install them, you can proceed along the same lines as below after installing the corresponding compiler from a binary package, adding `ada` or `d` to the `--enable-languages` line.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Caution

If you are upgrading GCC from any other version prior to 12.2.0, then you must be careful compiling 3rd party kernel modules. You should ensure that the kernel and all its native modules are also compiled using the same version of GCC that you use to build the 3rd party module. This issue does not affect native kernel (and kernel modules) updates, as the instructions below are a complete reinstallation of GCC. If you have existing 3rd party modules installed, ensure they are recompiled using the updated version of GCC. As always, never update the kernel headers from the ones used when Glibc was compiled during LFS.

Some system headers need to be fixed to be used with GCC. This is done during the installation of GCC, and the “fixed” headers are installed in `/usr/lib/gcc/<machine triplet>/<GCC version>/include-fixed` . This is harmless if GCC is built during the LFS stage. But if you reinstall GCC in BLFS, some of the BLFS packages may be “fixed”. If one of those packages is reinstalled afterwards, the “fixed” headers are not updated, which may lead to version mismatches. In case that happens, the “fixed” headers must be updated by running (as `root`): **/usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/12.2.0/install-tools/mkheaders** . The machine triplet may be different on a 32-bit system.

### GCC Dependencies

#### Optional

[GDB-13.1](13.Programming.md#138-gdb-131), [Valgrind-3.20.0](13.Programming.md#1336-valgrind-3200) (for tests), and [ISL](https://repo.or.cz/isl.git) (to enable graphite optimization)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gcc](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gcc)

Installation of GCC
-------------------

### Important

Even if you specify only languages other than C and C++ to the **./configure** command below, the installation process will overwrite your existing GCC C and C++ compilers and libraries. Running the full suite of tests is recommended.

Do not continue with the **make install** command until you are confident the build was successful. You can compare your test results with those found at [https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/). You may also want to refer to the information found in the GCC section of Chapter 8 in the LFS book ([../../../../lfs/view/11.3-systemd/chapter08/gcc.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/11.3-systemd/chapter08/gcc.html)).

The instructions below are intentionally performing a “bootstrap” process. Bootstrapping is needed for robustness and is highly recommended when upgrading the compilers version. To disable bootstrap anyway, add `--disable-bootstrap` to the **./configure** options below.

Install GCC by running the following commands:

```bash
case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64)
    sed -i.orig '/m64=/s/lib64/lib/' gcc/config/i386/t-linux64
  ;;
esac

mkdir build                                            &&
cd    build                                            &&

../configure                                           \
    --prefix=/usr                                      \
    --disable-multilib                                 \
    --with-system-zlib                                 \
    --enable-default-pie                               \
    --enable-default-ssp                               \
    --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,go,objc,obj-c++ &&
make
```

If you have installed additional packages such as Valgrind and GDB, the GCC part of the test suite will run more tests than in LFS. Some of those will report FAIL and others XPASS (pass when expected to FAIL). As of gcc-12.2.0, about 60 FAIL occur in the “guality” suite, as well as miscellaneous failures throughout the rest of the test suite, fifteen of which are already present in the GCC tests of LFS. If all the compilers above are built, there will be around 80 unexpected failures out of over 482,000 tests. To run the tests, issue:

```bash
ulimit -s 32768 &&
make -k check
```

The tests are very long, and the results may be hard to find in the logs, specially if you use parallel jobs with make. You can get a summary of the tests with:

```bash
../contrib/test_summary
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&

mkdir -pv /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib              &&
mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib &&

chown -v -R root:root \
    /usr/lib/gcc/*linux-gnu/12.2.0/include{,-fixed}
```

Some packages expect to find the C preprocessor in `/lib` or may refer to the C compiler under the name **cc**. The following symbolic links are not needed if you have followed the LFS instructions, since they have been already created. If you do not have them on your system, issue as the `root` user:

```bash
ln -v -sf ../usr/bin/cpp /lib          &&
ln -v -sf gcc /usr/bin/cc              &&
install -v -dm755 /usr/lib/bfd-plugins &&
ln -sfv ../../libexec/gcc/$(gcc -dumpmachine)/12.2.0/liblto_plugin.so /usr/lib/bfd-plugins/
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**mkdir build; cd build**: The GCC documentation recommends building the package in a dedicated build directory.

`--disable-multilib`: This parameter ensures that files are created for the specific architecture of your computer.

`--with-system-zlib`: Uses the system zlib instead of the bundled one. zlib is used for compressing and decompressing GCC's intermediate language in LTO (Link Time Optimization) object files.

`--enable-default-pie`: Makes the `-fpie` option the default when compiling programs. Together with the [ASLR](Glossary.md) feature enabled in the kernel, this defeats some kind of attacks based on known memory layouts.

`--enable-default-ssp`: Makes the `-fstack-protector-strong` option the default when compiling programs. [SSP](Glossary.md) is a technique preventing alteration of the program flow by corrupting the parameter stack.

`--enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,go,objc,obj-c++`: This command identifies which languages to build. You may modify this command to remove undesired languages. Other languages can be added, including ADA, D, BRIG (add `brig` to the list of enabled languages), a binary format for HSAIL (Heterogeneous System Architecture Intermediate Language), and JIT (add `jit` to the list of enabled languages), a library which can be linked into interpreters that want to generate machine code “on the fly” at run-time. They have not been tested by the BLFS developers.

**ulimit -s 32768**: This command prevents several tests from running out of stack space.

**make -k check**: This command runs the test suite without stopping if any errors are encountered.

**../contrib/test_summary**: This command will produce a summary of the test suite results. You can append **| grep -A7 Summ** to the command to produce an even more condensed version of the summary. You may also wish to redirect the output to a file for review and comparison later on.

**mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py ...**: The installation stage puts some files used by gdb under the `/usr/lib` directory. This generates spurious error messages when performing **ldconfig**. This command moves the files to another location.

**chown -v -R root:root /usr/lib/gcc/*linux-gnu/...**: If the package is built by a user other than root, the ownership of the installed `include` directory (and its content) will be incorrect. This command changes the ownership to the `root` user and group.

## 13.7 GC-8.2.2
--------

Introduction to GC
------------------

The GC package contains the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector, which can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for the C malloc function or C++ new operator. It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise accessed. The collector is also used by a number of programming language implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want to facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the simple collector interface. Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

#### Optional

[libatomic_ops-7.6.14](9.General_libraries.md#931-libatomic_ops-7614)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gc](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gc)

Installation of GC
------------------

Install GC by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr      \
            --enable-cplusplus \
            --disable-static   \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gc-8.2.2 &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&
install -v -m644 doc/gc.man /usr/share/man/man3/gc_malloc.3
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--docdir=/usr/share/doc/gc-8.2.2`: This option is used so the package will install the documentation in a versioned directory.

`--enable-cplusplus`: This parameter enables the building and installing of the C++ library along with the standard C library.

`--disable-static`: This switch prevents installation of static versions of the libraries.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** None

**Installed Libraries:** libcord.so, libgc.so, libgccpp.so, and libgctba.so

**Installed Directories:** /usr/include/gc and /usr/share/doc/gc-8.2.2

### Short Descriptions

`libcord.so`            contains a tree-based string library.

`libgc.so`              contains a C interface to the conservative garbage collector, primarily designed to replace the C malloc function.

`libgccpp.so`           contains a C++ interface to the conservative garbage collector.

`libgctba.so`           contains a C++ interface to throw bad allocations.


## 13.8 GDB-13.1
--------

Introduction to GDB
-------------------

GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on “inside” another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. Note that GDB is most effective when tracing programs and libraries that were built with debugging symbols and not stripped.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

*   Estimated build time: 2.1 SBU (Using parallelism=4; add 0.5 SBU for docs; add 20 SBU for tests)
    

### GDB Dependencies

#### Recommended Runtime Dependency

[six-1.16.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) (Python 3 module, required at run-time to use GDB scripts from various LFS/BLFS packages with Python 3 installed in LFS)

#### Optional

[Doxygen-1.9.6](13.Programming.md#135-doxygen-196), [GCC-12.2.0](13.Programming.md#136-gcc-1220) (ada, gfortran, and go are used for tests), [Guile-3.0.9](13.Programming.md#1311-guile-309), [Python-2.7.18](13.Programming.md#1322-python-2718), [rustc-1.67.1](13.Programming.md#1327-rustc-1671) (used for some tests), [Valgrind-3.20.0](13.Programming.md#1336-valgrind-3200), and [SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) (run-time, used for tests)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gdb](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/gdb)

Installation of GDB
-------------------

Install GDB by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build &&
cd    build &&

../configure --prefix=/usr          \
             --with-system-readline \
             --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 &&
make
```

Optionally, to build the API documentation using [Doxygen-1.9.6](13.Programming.md#135-doxygen-196), run:

```bash
make -C gdb/doc doxy
```

To test the results, issue:

```bash
pushd gdb/testsuite &&
make  site.exp      &&
echo  "set gdb_test_timeout 120" >> site.exp &&
runtest
popd
```

See gdb/testsuite/README and [TestingGDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/TestingGDB). There are many problems with the test suite:

*   Clean directories are needed if re-running the tests. For that reason, make a copy of the compiled source code directory before the tests in case you need to run the tests again.
    
*   Results depend on installed compilers.
    
*   A test run of the test suite had 33 unexpected failures out of over 106000 tests.
    
*   On some systems, the gdb.tui test suite will fail if running over SSH.
    
*   On some AMD-based systems, over 200 additional tests may fail due to a difference in the threading implementation on those CPUs.
    

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make -C gdb install
```

If you have built the API documentation, it is now in gdb/doc/doxy. You can install it (as the `root` user):

```bash
install -d /usr/share/doc/gdb-13.1 &&
rm -rf gdb/doc/doxy/xml &&
cp -Rv gdb/doc/doxy /usr/share/doc/gdb-13.1
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--with-system-readline`: This switch forces GDB to use the copy of Readline installed in LFS.

`--with-python=/usr/bin/python3`: This switch forces GDB to use Python 3. Remove this switch if you have installed [Python-2.7.18](13.Programming.md#1322-python-2718) and want to use it instead of Python 3.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** gcore, gdb and gdbserver

**Installed Library:** None

**Installed Directories:** /usr/{include,share}/gdb and /usr/share/doc/gdb-13.1

### Short Descriptions

**gcore**               generates a core dump of a running program.

**gdb**                 is the GNU Debugger.

**gdbserver**           is a remote server for the GNU debugger (it allows programs to be debugged from a different machine).


## 13.9 Git-2.39.2
--------

Introduction to Git
-------------------

Git is a free and open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do. Git is used for version control of files, much like tools such as [Mercurial-6.3.2](13.Programming.md#1316-mercurial-632), Bazaar, [Subversion-1.14.2](13.Programming.md#1330-subversion-1142), [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/), Perforce, and Team Foundation Server.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Git Dependencies

#### Recommended

[cURL-7.88.1](17.Networking_libraries.md#172-curl-7881) (needed to use Git over http, https, ftp or ftps)

#### Optional

[GnuPG-2.4.0](4.Security.md#46-gnupg-240) (runtime, may be used to sign Git commits or tags, or verify the signatures of them), [OpenSSH-9.2p1](4.Security.md#418-openssh-92p1) (runtime, needed to use Git over ssh), [pcre2-10.42](9.General_libraries.md#978-pcre2-1042) (or the deprecated [PCRE-8.45](9.General_libraries.md#977-pcre-845)), in either case configured with `--enable-jit`, [Subversion-1.14.2](13.Programming.md#1330-subversion-1142) with Perl bindings (runtime, for **git svn**), [Tk-8.6.13](13.Programming.md#1334-tk-8613) (gitk, a simple Git repository viewer, uses Tk at runtime), [Valgrind-3.20.0](13.Programming.md#1336-valgrind-3200), [Authen::SASL](https://metacpan.org/pod/Authen::SASL) and [MIME::Base64](https://metacpan.org/pod/MIME::Base64) (both runtime, for **git send-email**), and [IO-Socket-SSL-2.081](13.Programming.md#1319-perl-modules) (runtime, for **git send-email** to connect to a SMTP server with SSL encryption)

#### Optional (to create the man pages, html docs and other docs)

[xmlto-0.0.28](49.Extensible_markup_language_XML.md#496-xmlto-0028) and [asciidoc-10.2.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) , and also [dblatex](https://dblatex.sourceforge.net/) (for the PDF version of the user manual), and [docbook2x](https://docbook2x.sourceforge.net/) to create info pages

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/git](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/git)

Installation of Git
-------------------

Install Git by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --with-gitconfig=/etc/gitconfig \
            --with-python=python3 &&
make
```

You can build the man pages and/or html docs, or use downloaded ones. If you choose to build them, use the next two instructions.

If you have installed [asciidoc-10.2.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) you can create the html version of the man pages and other docs:

```bash
make html
```

If you have installed [asciidoc-10.2.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) and [xmlto-0.0.28](49.Extensible_markup_language_XML.md#496-xmlto-0028) you can create the man pages:

```bash
make man
```

The test suite can be run in parallel mode. To run the test suite, issue: **make test**. If run as a normal user, 0 tests should be reported as failed in the final summary.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make perllibdir=/usr/lib/perl5/5.36/site_perl install
```

### If you created the man pages and/or html docs

Install the man pages as the `root` user:

```bash
make install-man
```

Install the html docs as the `root` user:

```bash
make htmldir=/usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 install-html
```

### If you downloaded the man pages and/or html docs

If you downloaded the man pages untar them as the `root` user:

```bash
tar -xf ../git-manpages-2.39.2.tar.xz \
    -C /usr/share/man --no-same-owner --no-overwrite-dir
```

If you downloaded the html docs untar them as the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -vp   /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 &&
tar   -xf   ../git-htmldocs-2.39.2.tar.xz \
      -C    /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 --no-same-owner --no-overwrite-dir &&

find        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \; &&
find        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### Reorganize text and html in the html-docs (both methods)

For both methods, the html-docs include a lot of plain text files. Reorganize the files as the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/man-pages/{html,text}         &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/{git*.txt,man-pages/text}     &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/{git*.,index.,man-pages/}html &&

mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/technical/{html,text}         &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/technical/{*.txt,text}        &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/technical/{*.,}html           &&

mkdir -vp /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/howto/{html,text}             &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/howto/{*.txt,text}            &&
mv        /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/howto/{*.,}html               &&

sed -i '/^<a href=/s|howto/|&html/|' /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/howto-index.html &&
sed -i '/^\* link:/s|howto/|&html/|' /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2/howto-index.txt
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--with-gitconfig=/etc/gitconfig`: This sets `/etc/gitconfig` as the file that stores the default, system wide, Git settings.

`--with-python=python3`: Use this switch to use Python 3, instead of the EOL'ed Python 2. Python is used for the **git p4** interface to Perforce repositories, and also used in some tests.

`--with-libpcre2`: Use this switch if PCRE2 is installed and has been built with the non-default JIT enabled.

`--with-libpcre1`: As an alternative to PCRE2, use this switch if the deprecated PCRE is installed and has been built with the non-default JIT enabled.

**tar -xf ../git-manpages-2.39.2.tar.gz -C /usr/share/man --no-same-owner**: This untars `git-manpages-2.39.2.tar.gz`. The `-C` option makes tar change directory to `/usr/share/man` before it starts to decompress the docs. The `--no-same-owner` option stops tar from preserving the user and group details of the files. This is useful as that user or group may not exist on your system; this could (potentially) be a security risk.

**mv /usr/share/doc/git-2.39.2 ...**: These commands move some of the files into subfolders to make it easier to sort through the docs and find what you're looking for.

**find ... chmod ...**: These commands correct the permissions in the shipped documentation tar file.

**scalar**              is a repository management tool that optimizes Git for use in large repositories.


## 13.10 Running a Git Server
--------

Introduction
------------

This section will describe how to set up, administer and secure a git server. Git has many options available. For more detailed documentation see [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

### Server Dependencies

#### Required

[git-2.39.2](13.Programming.md#139-git-2392) and [OpenSSH-9.2p1](4.Security.md#418-openssh-92p1)

Setting up a Git Server
-----------------------

The following instructions will install a git server. It will be set up to use OpenSSH as the secure remote access method.

Configuration of the server consists of the following steps:

#### 1. Set Up Users, Groups, and Permissions

You will need to be user `root` for the initial portion of configuration. Create the `git` user and group and set and unusable password hash with the following commands:

```bash
groupadd -g 58 git &&
useradd -c "git Owner" -d /home/git -m -g git -s /usr/bin/git-shell -u 58 git &&
sed -i '/^git:/s/^git:[^:]:/git:NP:/' /etc/shadow
```

Putting in an unusable password hash (replacing the `!` by `NP`) unlocks the account but it cannot be used to login via password authentication. That is required by sshd to work properly. Next, create some files and directories in the home directory of the git user allowing access to the git repository using ssh keys.

```bash
install -o git -g git -dm0700 /home/git/.ssh &&
install -o git -g git -m0600 /dev/null /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

For any developer who should have access to the repository add his/her public ssh key to `/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys`. First, prepend some options to prevent users from using the connection to git for port forwarding to other machines the git server might reach.

```bash
echo -n "no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty " >> /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys &&
cat <user-ssh-key> >> /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

It is also useful to set the default name of the initial branch of new repositories by modifying the git configuration. As the `root` user, run:

```bash
git config --system init.defaultBranch trunk
```

Finally add the `/usr/bin/git-shell` entry to the `/etc/shells` configuration file. This shell has been set in the `git` user profile and is to make sure that only git related actions can be executed:

```bash
echo "/usr/bin/git-shell" >> /etc/shells
```

#### 2. Create a git repository

The repository can be anywhere on the filesystem. It is important that the git user has read/write access to that location. We use `/srv/git` as base directory. Create a new git repository with the following commands (as the `root` user):

### Note

In all the instructions below, we use project1 as an example repository name. You should name your repository as a short descriptive name for your specific project.

```bash
install -o git -g git -m755 -d /srv/git/project1.git &&
cd /srv/git/project1.git                             &&
git init --bare                                      &&
chown -R git:git .
```

#### 3. Populate the repository from a client system

### Note

All the instructions in this section and the next should be done on a user system, not the server system.

Now that the repository is created, it can be used by the developers to put some files into it. Once the ssh key of the user is imported to git's `authorized_keys` file, the user can interact with the repository.

A minimal configuration should be available on the developer's system specifying its user name and the email address. Create this minimal config file on client side:

```bash
cat > ~/.gitconfig <<EOF
[user]
        name = <users-name>
        email = <users-email-address>
EOF
```

On the developer's machine, set up some files to be pushed to the repository as the initial content:

### Note

The gitserver term used below should be the host name (or ip address) of the git server.

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init --initial-branch=trunk
git remote add origin git@gitserver:/srv/git/project1.git
cat >README <<EOF
This is the README file
EOF
git add README
git commit -m 'Initial creation of README'
git push --set-upstream origin trunk
```

The initial content is now pushed to the server and is available for other users. On the current machine, the argument `--set-upstream origin trunk` is now no longer required as the local repository is now connected to the remote repository. Subsequent pushes can be performed as

```bash
git push
```

Other developers can now clone the repository and do modifications to the content (as long as their ssh keys has been installed):

```bash
git clone git@gitserver:/srv/git/project1.git
cd project1
vi README
git commit -am 'Fix for README file'
git push
```

### Note

This is a very basic server setup based on OpenSSH access. All developers are using the `git` user to perform actions on the repository and the changes users are committing can be distinguished as the local user name (see `~/.gitconfig`) is recorded in the changesets.

Access is restricted by the public keys added to git's `authorized_keys` file and there is no option for the public to export/clone the repository. To enable this, continue with step 4 to set up the git server for public read-only access.

In the URL used to clone the project, the absolute path (here `/srv/git/project1.git`) has to be specified as the repository is not in git's home directory but in `/srv/git`. To get rid of the need to expose the structure of the server installation, a symlink can be added in git's home directory for each project like this:

```bash
ln -svf /srv/git/project1.git /home/git/
```

Now, the repository can be cloned using

```bash
git clone git@gitserver:project1.git
```

#### 4. Configure the Server

The setup described above makes a repository available for authenticated users (via providing the ssh public key file). There is also a simple way to publish the repository to unauthenticated users — of course without write access.

The combination of access via ssh (for authenticated users) and the export of repositories to unauthenticated users via the daemon is in most cases enough for a development site.

### Note

The daemon will be reachable at port `9418` by default. Make sure that your firewall setup allows access to that port.

To start the server at boot time, install the `git-daemon.service` unit from the [blfs-systemd-units-20220720](2.Important_information.md#24-blfs-systemd-units) package:

```bash
make install-git-daemon
```

In order to allow git to export a repository, a file named `git-daemon-export-ok` is required in each repository directory on the server. The file needs no content, just its existence enables, its absence disables the export of that repository.

```bash
touch /srv/git/project1.git/git-daemon-export-ok
```

Along with the `git-daemon.service` unit, a configuration file named `/etc/default/git-daemon` has been installed. Review this configuration file to match your needs.

There are only three options to set in the configuration file:

*   GIT_BASE_DIR=<dirname>
    
    Specify the location of the git repositories. Relative paths used when accessing the daemon will translated relative to this directory.
    
*   DFT_REPO_DIR=<dirname>
    
    This directory is added to the white list of allowed directories. This variable can hold multiple directory names but is usually set equal to `GIT_BASE_DIR`.
    
*   GIT_DAEMON_OPTS=<options>
    
    In case special options to the **git daemon** command are needed, they have to be specified in this setting. One example might be to adjust the port number where daemon is listening. In this case, add `--port=<port number>` to this variable. For more information about which options can be set, take a look at the output of **git daemon --help**.
    

After starting the daemon, unauthenticated users can clone exported repositories by using

```bash
git clone git://gitserver/project1.git
```

As the base directory is `/srv/git` by default (or set to a custom value in the configuration), git interprets the incoming path (/project1.git) relative to that base directory so that the repository in `/srv/git/project1.git` is served.

## 13.13 LLVM-15.0.7
--------

Introduction to LLVM
--------------------

The LLVM package contains a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. The Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) Core libraries provide a modern source and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!). These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").

Clang provides new C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-ends for LLVM and is required by some desktop packages such as firefox and for rust if that is built using the system LLVM.

The Compiler RT package provides runtime sanitizer and profiling libraries for developers who use Clang and LLVM.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/llvm](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/llvm)

Installation of LLVM
--------------------

Starting with version 15.0.0, an additional tarball `llvm-cmake-15.0.7.src.tar.xz` is needed. The upstream expects it extracted at the same level as the `llvm-15.0.7.src.tar.xz` tarball, and the extracted directory renamed to `cmake`. Extract it and modify the build system to avoid creating a directory outside the `llvm-15.0.7.src` hierarchy:

```bash
tar -xf ../llvm-cmake-15.0.7.src.tar.xz &&
sed '/LLVM_COMMON_CMAKE_UTILS/s@../cmake@cmake-15.0.7.src@' \
    -i CMakeLists.txt
```

Install clang into the source tree by running the following commands:

```bash
tar -xf ../clang-15.0.7.src.tar.xz -C tools &&
mv tools/clang-15.0.7.src tools/clang
```

If you have downloaded compiler-rt, install it into the source tree by running the following commands:

```bash
tar -xf ../compiler-rt-15.0.7.src.tar.xz -C projects &&
mv projects/compiler-rt-15.0.7.src projects/compiler-rt
```

There are many Python scripts in this package which use **/usr/bin/env python** to access the system Python which on LFS is [Python-3.11.2](13.Programming.md#1323-python-3112). Use the following command to fix these scripts:

```bash
grep -rl '#!.*python' | xargs sed -i '1s/python$/python3/'
```

If you have downloaded clang, apply the following patch to enable [SSP](Glossary.md) by default in compiled programs.

```bash
patch -Np2 -d tools/clang <../clang-15.0.7-enable_default_ssp-1.patch
```

Install LLVM by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -v build &&
cd       build &&

CC=gcc CXX=g++                                  \
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr               \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_FFI=ON                      \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON                \
      -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON                 \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON                     \
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;AMDGPU;BPF" \
      -DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR=/usr/include       \
      -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF             \
      -DCLANG_DEFAULT_PIE_ON_LINUX=ON           \
      -Wno-dev -G Ninja ..                      &&
ninja
```

If you have installed [recommonmark-0.7.1](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) and its dependencies, you can generate the html documentation and manual pages with the following commands:

```bash
cmake -DLLVM_BUILD_DOCS=ON            \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=ON         \
      -DSPHINX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF \
      -Wno-dev -G Ninja ..            &&
ninja docs-llvm-html  docs-llvm-man
```

The clang documentation can be built too:

```bash
ninja docs-clang-html docs-clang-man
```

To test the results, issue: **ninja check-all**. Tests are built with all available cores, but run using the number of online processors. (The difference is that available cores can be limited using **taskset**, but taking them offline requires echoing 0 to `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<N>/online` by the `root` user and makes them temporarily unusable by all jobs on the machine.) Note that four tests out of more than 64,700 are known to fail: `DataFlowSanitizer-x86_64 :: custom.cpp`, `DataFlowSanitizer-x86_64 :: origin_unaligned_memtrans.c`, `DataFlowSanitizer-x86_64 :: release_shadow_space.c`, `LLVM :: tools/llvm-libtool-darwin/L-and-l.test`,

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
ninja install &&
cp bin/FileCheck /usr/bin
```

If you have built the llvm documentation, it has been installed by the above command, but it needs to be moved. As the `root` user:

```bash
install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/llvm-15.0.7            &&
mv -v /usr/share/doc/LLVM/llvm /usr/share/doc/llvm-15.0.7 &&
rmdir -v --ignore-fail-on-non-empty /usr/share/doc/LLVM
```

If you have built the clang documentation, it has been installed, but needs to be moved too. Again as the `root` user:

```bash
install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/llvm-15.0.7             &&
mv -v /usr/share/doc/LLVM/clang /usr/share/doc/llvm-15.0.7 &&
rmdir -v --ignore-fail-on-non-empty /usr/share/doc/LLVM
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`-DLLVM_ENABLE_FFI=ON`: This switch allows LLVM to use libffi.

`-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON`: This switch builds the libraries as static and links all of them into an unique shared one. This is the recommended way of building a shared library.

`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: This switch enables compiler optimizations in order to speed up the code and reduce its size. It also disables some compile checks which are not necessary on a production system.

`-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;AMDGPU;BPF"`: This switch enables building for the same target as the host, and also for the r600 AMD GPU used by the Mesa r600 and radeonsi drivers. The BPF target is required to build [v4l-utils-1.22.1](42.Multimedia_libraries_and_drivers.md#4256-v4l-utils-1221). The Default is all of the targets. You can use a semicolon separated list. Valid targets are: host, X86, Sparc, PowerPC, ARM, AArch64, Mips, Hexagon, Xcore, M68K, MSP430, NVPTX, SystemZ, AMDGPU, BPF, CppBackend, or all.

`-DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON`: Used in conjunction with `-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON`, this switch enables linking the tools against the shared library instead of the static ones. It slightly reduces their size and also ensures that llvm-config will correctly use libLLVM-15.so.

`-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`: This switch is used to build LLVM with run-time type information. This is required for building [Mesa-22.3.5](24.Graphical_environments.md#2416-mesa-2235).

`-DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR=/usr/include`: This switch is used to tell the build system the location of binutils headers, which were installed in LFS. This allows the building of `LLVMgold.so`, which is needed for building programs with **clang** and Link Time Optimization (LTO).

`-DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF`: is used to disable generation build targets for the LLVM benchmarks. This option requires additional code that is not currently available.

`-DCLANG_DEFAULT_PIE_ON_LINUX=ON`: makes `-fpie` option the default when compiling programs. Together with the [ASLR](Glossary.md) feature enabled in the kernel, this defeats some kind of attacks based on known memory layouts.

`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`: if used instead of `-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON` and `-DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON`, builds all the LLVM libraries (about 60) as shared libraries instead of static.

`-DLLVM_ENABLE_DOXYGEN`: Enables the generation of browsable HTML documentation if you have installed [Doxygen-1.9.6](13.Programming.md#135-doxygen-196). You should run **make doxygen-html** afterwards, and install the generated documentation manually.

## 13.14 Lua-5.4.4
--------

Introduction to Lua
-------------------

Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lua](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/lua)

Installation of Lua
-------------------

Some packages check for the pkg-config file for Lua, which is created with:

```bash
cat > lua.pc << "EOF"
V=5.4
R=5.4.4

prefix=/usr
INSTALL_BIN=${prefix}/bin
INSTALL_INC=${prefix}/include
INSTALL_LIB=${prefix}/lib
INSTALL_MAN=${prefix}/share/man/man1
INSTALL_LMOD=${prefix}/share/lua/${V}
INSTALL_CMOD=${prefix}/lib/lua/${V}
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include

Name: Lua
Description: An Extensible Extension Language
Version: ${R}
Requires:
Libs: -L${libdir} -llua -lm -ldl
Cflags: -I${includedir}
EOF
```

Install Lua by running the following commands:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../lua-5.4.4-shared_library-2.patch &&
make linux
```

To test the results, issue: **make test**. “This will run the interpreter and print its version”. More comprehensive tests can be performed if you downloaded the "Test suite" tarball. Those tests need to be executed after the package is installed, thus we defer to the description below.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make INSTALL_TOP=/usr                \
     INSTALL_DATA="cp -d"            \
     INSTALL_MAN=/usr/share/man/man1 \
     TO_LIB="liblua.so liblua.so.5.4 liblua.so.5.4.4" \
     install &&

mkdir -pv                      /usr/share/doc/lua-5.4.4 &&
cp -v doc/*.{html,css,gif,png} /usr/share/doc/lua-5.4.4 &&

install -v -m644 -D lua.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/lua.pc
```

Here we describe only the "Basic tests". Untar the tarball and change to the `lua-5.4.4-tests` directory, then issue **lua -e "_U=true" all.lua**. If the tests finish without error, you will see a message containing the string "final OK".

Introduction to Lua 5.2
-----------------------

Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. It is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.

This is an older version of Lua needed only for compatibility with other programs such as [Wireshark-4.0.3](16.Networking_utilities.md#168-wireshark-403).

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

       -e '/^LUAC_T=/ s/luac/luac5.2/'     \
       -i src/Makefile &&

make MYCFLAGS="-fPIC" linux
```

The installation of this package is complex, so we will use the DESTDIR method of installation:

```bash
make TO_BIN='lua5.2 luac5.2'                     \
     TO_LIB="liblua5.2.so liblua5.2.so.5.2 liblua5.2.so.5.2.4" \
     INSTALL_DATA="cp -d"                        \
     INSTALL_TOP=$PWD/install/usr                \
     INSTALL_INC=$PWD/install/usr/include/lua5.2 \
     INSTALL_MAN=$PWD/install/usr/share/man/man1 \
     install &&

install -Dm644 lua.pc install/usr/lib/pkgconfig/lua52.pc &&

mkdir -pv install/usr/share/doc/lua-5.2.4 &&
cp -v doc/*.{html,css,gif,png} install/usr/share/doc/lua-5.2.4 &&

ln -s liblua5.2.so install/usr/lib/liblua.so.5.2   &&

mv install/usr/share/man/man1/{lua.1,lua5.2.1} &&
mv install/usr/share/man/man1/{luac.1,luac5.2.1}
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
chown -R root:root install  &&
cp -a install/* /
```

Command Explanations

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mercurial](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/mercurial)

Installation of Mercurial
-------------------------

Build Mercurial by issuing the following command:

```bash
make build
```

To build the documentation (requires [docutils-0.19](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules)), issue:

```bash
make doc
```

To run the test suite, issue:

```bash
TESTFLAGS="-j<N> --tmpdir tmp --blacklist blacklists/fsmonitor --blacklist blacklists/linux-vfat" make check
```

where `<N>` is an integer between one and the number of ( processor X threads ), inclusive. Several tests (about 20) fail because some error messages have changed in Python, or some deprecation warnings are printed, that were not present when the test was designed. In order to investigate any apparently failing tests, you may use the **run-tests.py** script. To see the almost forty switches, some of them very useful, issue **tests/run-tests.py --help**. Running the following commands, you will execute only the tests that failed before:

```bash
pushd tests  &&
  rm -rf tmp &&
  ./run-tests.py --tmpdir tmp test-gpg.t
popd
```

Normally, the previous failures will be reproducible. However, if you add the switch `--debug` before `--tmpdir`, and run the tests again, some failures may disappear, which is a problem with the test suite. If this happens, there will be no more of these failures even if you do not pass the --debug switch again.

An interesting switch is `--time`, which will generate a table of all the executed tests and their respective start, end, user, system and real times once the tests are complete. Note that these switches may be used with **make check** by including them in the `TESTFLAGS` environment variable.

Install Mercurial by running the following command (as `root`):

```bash
make PREFIX=/usr install-bin
```

If you built the documentation, install it by running the following command (as `root`):

```bash
make PREFIX=/usr install-doc
```

After installation, two very quick and simple tests should run correctly. The first one needs some configuration:

```bash
cat >> ~/.hgrc << "EOF"
[ui]
username = <user_name> <user@mail>
EOF
```

where you must replace <user_name> and <your@mail> (mail is optional and can be omitted). With the user identity defined, run **hg debuginstall** and several lines will be displayed, the last one reading "no problems detected". Another quick and simple test is just **hg**, which should output basic commands that can be used with **hg**.

Configuring Mercurial
---------------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/mercurial/hgrc` and `~/.hgrc`

The great majority of extensions are disabled by default. Run **hg help extensions** if you need to enable any, e.g. when investigating test failures. This will output a list of enabled and disabled extensions, as well as more information such as how to enable or disable extensions using configuration files.

If you have installed [make-ca-1.12](4.Security.md#42-make-ca-112) and want Mercurial to use the certificates, as the `root` user, issue:

```bash
install -v -d -m755 /etc/mercurial &&
cat > /etc/mercurial/hgrc << "EOF"
[web]
cacerts = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
EOF

## 13.19 Perl Modules
--------

Introduction to Perl Modules
----------------------------

The Perl module packages (also referred to as Distributions, because each can contain multiple modules) add useful objects to the Perl language. The packages listed on this page are required or recommended for other packages in the book. If they have dependent modules, those are either on this page or else on the next page ([Perl Module Dependencies](13.Programming.md#1320-perl-module-dependencies)).

In many cases, only the required or recommended dependencies are listed - there might be other modules which allow more tests to be run, but omitting them will still allow the tests to `PASS`.

For a few modules, the BLFS editors have determined that other modules still listed as prerequisites are not required, and omitted them.

Where an alphabetically-earlier dependency of the same module pulls in a dependency, it is not mentioned for the later dependencies of the same module. You should build the listed dependencies in order.

It is generally worth running the tests for perl modules, they often can show problems such as missing dependencies which are required to use the module. Here, the editors have attempted to separate those dependencies which are only required for running test suites, but they will not be mentioned for a module where one of its dependencies uses that module for its own test suite. That is to say, if you intend to run the test suites, please run them for each dependency of the module.

It is possible to automatically install the current versions of a module and all missing or too-old dependencies recommended by upstream using CPAN. See [CPAN automated install of perl modules](13.Programming.md#1319-perl-modules) at the end of this page.

Most of these modules only install files below `/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.xx.y` and those will not be documented. One or two install programs (mostly, perl scripts), or a library, into `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/lib/` and these are documented.

CPAN automated install of perl modules
--------------------------------------

#### Automatic Installation of Perl Modules.

There is an alternate way of installing the modules using the **cpan** shell **install** command. The command automatically downloads the latest source from the CPAN archive for the module and any missing prerequisite modules listed by upstream. Then for each module it extracts it, runs the compilation, the tests and installs it.

You still need to install any non-perl dependencies before running the automated installation method. You may wish to clean out the `build/` directory after installing, to free up the space. If any post-install actions such as creating a symlink are mentioned, you should also do those.

The first time you run **cpan**, you'll be prompted to enter some information regarding download locations and methods. This information is retained in files located in `~/.cpan`.

In particular, you may wish to configure it so that [Sudo-1.9.13p1](4.Security.md#425-sudo-1913p1) is used for the installs, allowing you to build and test as a regular user. The following examples have not used that approach.

Start the **cpan** shell by issuing '**cpan**' as the `root` user. Any module may now be installed from the `cpan>`  prompt with the command:

```bash
install <Module::Name>
```

For additional commands and help, issue '**help**' from the `cpan>`  prompt.

Alternatively, for scripted or non-interactive installations, use the following syntax as the `root` user to install one or more modules:

```bash
cpan -i <Module1::Name> <Module2::Name>
```

Review the `cpan.1` man page for additional parameters you can pass to **cpan** on the command line.


## 13.20 Perl Module Dependencies
--------

Perl Modules which are only required by other modules
-----------------------------------------------------

The modules on the previous page are referenced from other pages in BLFS, but these modules are only in the book as dependencies of those modules. If you use the CPAN install method, you do not need to read this page.

The BLFS editors pay much less attention to these modules, and the versions will not be regularly reviewed. In all cases, only the required or recommended dependencies are listed - there might be other modules which allow more tests to be run, but omitting them will still allow the tests to `PASS`.

### Note

The links on this page (to metacpan.org) should go to "known good" versions, for which their dependencies are correct. If you wish to use a later version, please check the Changes file at https://metacpan.org - sometimes added dependencies are listed, other times not. Some of these modules have very frequent updates, often bringing different dependencies. The linked metacpan.org versions below were known to work with the the module versions in BLFS when last reviewed.

However, if you notice that the Changes file for a newer version than is in the current development book reports a fix for a security issue, please report this to either the blfs-dev or the blfs-support list.

Similarly, if you discover that an updated module on the previous page needs an extra dependency, please report this.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/php](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/php)

Installation of PHP
-------------------

You can use PHP for server-side scripting, command-line scripting or client-side GUI applications. This book provides instructions for setting up PHP for server-side scripting as it is the most common form.

### Note

PHP has many more **configure** options that will enable support for various things. You can use **./configure --help** to see a full list of the available options. Also, use of the [PHP web site](https://www.php.net/) is highly recommended, as their online docs are very good. An example of a **configure** command that utilizes many of the most common dependencies can be found at [https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/files/php_configure.txt](https://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/files/php_configure.txt).

If, for whatever reason, you don't have [libxml2-2.10.3](9.General_libraries.md#967-libxml2-2103) installed, you need to add `--disable-libxml` to the **configure** command in the instructions below. Note that this will prevent the **pear** command from being built.

Install PHP by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr                \
            --sysconfdir=/etc            \
            --localstatedir=/var         \
            --datadir=/usr/share/php     \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man      \
            --enable-fpm                 \
            --without-pear               \
            --with-fpm-user=apache       \
            --with-fpm-group=apache      \
            --with-fpm-systemd           \
            --with-config-file-path=/etc \
            --with-zlib                  \
            --enable-bcmath              \
            --with-bz2                   \
            --enable-calendar            \
            --enable-dba=shared          \
            --with-gdbm                  \
            --with-gmp                   \
            --enable-ftp                 \
            --with-gettext               \
            --enable-mbstring            \
            --disable-mbregex            \
            --with-readline              &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make test**. Several tests (out of over 16000) may fail, in which case you are asked whether you want to send the report to the PHP developers. If you want to automate the test, you may prefix the command with **yes "n" |** .

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install                                     &&
install -v -m644 php.ini-production /etc/php.ini &&

install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/php-8.2.3 &&
install -v -m644    CODING_STANDARDS* EXTENSIONS NEWS README* UPGRADING* \
                    /usr/share/doc/php-8.2.3
```

The default configuration files for the fastCGI process manager are installed only if they do not already exist on the system. If this is the first installation, they should be renamed, as the `root` user:

```bash
if [ -f /etc/php-fpm.conf.default ]; then
  mv -v /etc/php-fpm.conf{.default,} &&
  mv -v /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf{.default,}
fi
```

The pre-built HTML documentation is packaged in two forms: a tarball containing many individual files, useful for quick loading into your browser, and one large individual file, which is useful for using the search utility of your browser. If you downloaded either, or both, of the documentation files, issue the following commands as the `root` user to install them (note these instructions assume English docs, modify the tarball names below if necessary).

For the “Single HTML” file:

```bash
install -v -m644 ../php_manual_en.html.gz \
    /usr/share/doc/php-8.2.3 &&
gunzip -v /usr/share/doc/php-8.2.3/php_manual_en.html.gz
```

For the “Many HTML files” tarball:

```bash
tar -xvf ../php_manual_en.tar.gz \
    -C /usr/share/doc/php-8.2.3 --no-same-owner
```

The bundled pear is not installed because of a bug which might pollute the filesystem with several hidden files and directories. If pear is needed, execute the following commands to install it:

```bash
wget https://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar
php ./go-pear.phar
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--datadir=/usr/share/php`: This works around a bug in the build machinery, which installs some data to a wrong location.

`--enable-fpm`: This parameter allows building the fastCGI Process Manager.

`--with-fpm-systemd`: This parameter allows the FastCGI Process Manager to integrate with systemd.

`--without-pear`: This switch disables installation of bundled pear software.

`--with-config-file-path=/etc`: This parameter makes PHP look for the `php.ini` configuration file in `/etc`.

`--with-zlib`: This parameter adds support for Zlib compression.

`--enable-bcmath`: Enables **bc** style precision math functions.

`--with-bz2`: Adds support for Bzip2 compression functions.

`--enable-calendar`: This parameter provides support for calendar conversion.

`--enable-dba=shared`: This parameter enables support for database (dbm-style) abstraction layer functions.

`--enable-ftp`: This parameter enables FTP functions.

`--with-gettext`: Enables functions that use Gettext text translation.

`--enable-mbstring`: This parameter enables multibyte string support.

`--with-readline`: This parameter enables command line Readline support.

`--disable-libxml`: This option allows building PHP without libxml2 installed.

`--with-apxs2`: Instead of building the fastCGI process manager, it is possible to build an apache module. This has some performance penalty for heavy loaded servers, but may be easier to set up. This switch is incompatible with the `--enable-fpm` and `--with-fpm-...` switches.

`--with-mysqli=shared`: This option includes MySQLi support.

`--with-mysql-sock=/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`: Location of the MySQL unix socket pointer.

`--with-pdo-mysql=shared`: This option includes PDO: MySQL support.

`--with-tidy=shared`: This option includes tidy library support.

Configuring PHP
---------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/php.ini`, `/etc/pear.conf`, `/etc/php-fpm.conf`, and `/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf`

#### Configuration Information

The file used as the default `/etc/php.ini` configuration file is recommended by the PHP development team. This file modifies the default behavior of PHP. If no `/etc/php.ini` is used, all configuration settings fall to the defaults. You should review the comments in this file and ensure the changes are acceptable in your particular environment.

The fastCGI process manager uses the configuration file `/etc/php-fpm.conf`. The default file shipped with PHP includes all the `/etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf` in turn. There is a shipped `/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf` file, that contains the parameters related to the interaction with the Apache Web server.

You may have noticed the following from the output of the **make install** command:

```bash
You may want to add: /usr/lib/php to your php.ini include_path
```

If desired, add the entry using the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
sed -i 's@php/includes"@&\ninclude_path = ".:/usr/lib/php"@' \
    /etc/php.ini
```

To enable fastCGI support in the Apache web server, two LoadModule directives must be added to the `httpd.conf` file. They are commented out, so just issue the following command as `root` user:

```bash
sed -i -e '/proxy_module/s/^#//'      \
       -e '/proxy_fcgi_module/s/^#//' \
       /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
```

Those modules accept various **ProxyPass** directives. One possibility is (as the `root` user):

```bash
echo \
'ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.php)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/srv/www/$1' >> \
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
```

Additionally, it may be useful to add an entry for `index.php` to the DirectoryIndex directive of the `httpd.conf` file. Lastly, adding a line to set up the `.phps` extension to show highlighted PHP source may be desirable:

```bash
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
```

You'll need to restart the Apache web server after making any modifications to the `httpd.conf` file.

#### Systemd Unit

To start the **php-fpm** daemon at boot, install the systemd unit from the [blfs-systemd-units-20220720](2.Important_information.md#24-blfs-systemd-units) package by running the following command as the `root` user:

```bash
make install-php-fpm
```

## 13.22 Python-2.7.18
--------

Introduction to Python 2
------------------------

The Python 2 package contains the Python development environment. It is useful for object-oriented programming, writing scripts, prototyping large programs or developing entire applications. This version is for backward compatibility with other dependent packages.

### Note

Python2 has been deprecated by the upstream developers. Support for Python2 was discontinued on January 1st, 2020.

BLFS is attempting to use Python3 as much as possible, but some packages have not been updated to support Python3.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

#### Optional

[BlueZ-5.66](12.System_utilities.md#125-bluez-566) and [Valgrind-3.20.0](13.Programming.md#1336-valgrind-3200)

#### Optional (For more additional modules)

[libnsl-2.0.0](17.Networking_libraries.md#1711-libnsl-200) and [Tk-8.6.13](13.Programming.md#1334-tk-8613)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python)

Installation of Python 2
------------------------

First, disable the installation of a script that overwrites a more recent script:

```bash
sed -i '/2to3/d' ./setup.py
```

Install Python 2 by running the following commands:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../Python-2.7.18-security_fixes-1.patch &&
./configure --prefix=/usr                              \
            --enable-shared                            \
            --with-system-expat                        \
            --with-system-ffi                          \
            --enable-unicode=ucs4                     &&
make
```

If you invoke the tests, they will run through twice. To test the results, issue: **make -k test**. Several tests are known to fail, including `test_ftplib`, `test_ssl`, `test_urllib2_localnet`, `test_xml_etree`, `test_xml_etree_c`, and `test_minidom`. These failures are due to OpenSSL-3 and Expat-2.4.6.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make altinstall                                &&
ln -s python2.7        /usr/bin/python2        &&
ln -s python2.7-config /usr/bin/python2-config &&
chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0
```

Since Python 2 is in maintenance mode, and Python 3 is recommended by upstream for development, you probably do not need to install the documentation. However, if you still want to install documentation for both Python versions, be sure to define the `PYTHONDOCS` variable for the version you want to use, each time you need to consult the documentation. If you have downloaded the preformatted documentation from [https://docs.python.org/download.html](https://docs.python.org/download.html), install it as the `root` user:

```bash
install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18 &&

tar --strip-components=1                     \
    --no-same-owner                          \
    --directory /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18 \
    -xvf ../python-2.7.18-docs-html.tar.bz2 &&

find /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18 -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \; &&
find /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18 -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--with-system-expat`: This switch enables linking against system version of Expat.

`--with-system-ffi`: This switch enables linking against system version of libffi.

`--enable-unicode=ucs4`: This switch enables 32-bit Unicode support in Python.

`--with-ensurepip=yes` : This switch enables building **pip** and **setuptools** packaging programs. **setuptools** is needed for building some Python modules. This switch is not recommended because this version of Python is no longer maintained.

`--with-dbmliborder=bdb:gdbm:ndbm`: Use this switch if you want to build Python DBM Module against Berkeley DB instead of GDBM.

**make altinstall**: This make target omits some default symbolic links that may interfere with Python 3.

**chmod ...**: Fix permissions for libraries to be consistent with other libraries.

Configuring Python 2
--------------------

In order for **python** to find the installed documentation, you must add the following environment variable to individual user's or the system's profile:

```bash
export PYTHONDOCS=/usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** pydoc, python2 (symlink), python2-config (symlink), python2.7, python2.7-config, smtpd.py, and idle

**Installed Library:** libpython2.7.so

**Installed Directories:** /usr/{include,lib}/python2.7 and /usr/share/doc/python-2.7.18

### Short Descriptions

**idle**                is a wrapper script that opens a Python aware GUI editor. For this script to run, you must have installed Tk before Python so that the Tkinter Python module is built.

**pydoc**               is the Python documentation tool.

**python2**             is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

**python2.7**           is a version-specific name for the **python** program.

**smtpd.py**            is an SMTP proxy implemented in Python.


## 13.23 Python-3.11.2
--------

Introduction to Python 3
------------------------

The Python 3 package contains the Python development environment. This is useful for object-oriented programming, writing scripts, prototyping large programs or developing entire applications.

### Note

Python 3 was installed in LFS. The only reason to rebuild it here is if optional modules are needed, or to upgrade this package.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Important

If upgrading to a new Python-3 minor version (for example, from Python-3.10.x to Python-3.11.0), you will need to reinstall any Python3 modules you have installed. You should also reinstall packages that generate Python3 modules including [gobject-introspection-1.74.0](9.General_libraries.md#916-gobject-introspection-1740), [opencv-4.7.0](10.Graphics_and_font_libraries.md#1028-opencv-470), [Graphviz-7.1.0](11.General_utilities.md#116-graphviz-710) (if swig is installed).

Before you upgrade, you can get a complete list of modules installed with **pip3 list**.

The wheel module and meson from LFS will also have to be reinstalled: [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter08/wheel.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter08/wheel.html) and [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter08/meson.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter08/meson.html).

On systemd systems, it is also necessary to reinstall the MarkupSafe and Jinja2 modules from LFS: [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/systemd/chapter08/markupsafe.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/systemd/chapter08/markupsafe.html) and [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/systemd/chapter08/jinja2.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/systemd/chapter08/jinja2.html).

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python3](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/Python3)

Installation of Python 3
------------------------

Install Python 3 by running the following commands:

```bash
CXX="/usr/bin/g++"               \
./configure --prefix=/usr        \
            --enable-shared      \
            --with-system-expat  \
            --with-system-ffi    \
            --enable-optimizations &&
make
```

To test the result, issue **make test**. Some tests may need an Internet connection. Two tests, test_distutils and test_embed are known to fail.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

If upgrading and the documentation has been downloaded, optionally install it as the `root` user:

```bash
install -v -dm755 /usr/share/doc/python-3.11.2/html

tar --strip-components=1  \
    --no-same-owner       \
    --no-same-permissions \
    -C /usr/share/doc/python-3.11.2/html \
    -xvf ../python-3.11.2-docs-html.tar.bz2
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**CXX="/usr/bin/g++" ./configure ...**: Avoid an annoying message during configuration.

`--with-system-expat`: This switch enables linking against the system version of Expat.

`--with-system-ffi`: This switch enables linking against the system version of libffi.

`--with-dbmliborder=bdb:gdbm:ndbm`: Use this switch if you want to build the Python DBM Module against Berkeley DB instead of GDBM.

`--enable-optimizations`: This switch enables stable, but expensive, optimizations.

`--with-lto`: This optional switch enables thick Link Time Optimization. Unusually, it creates a much larger `/usr/lib/python3.11/config-3.11-<arch>-linux-gnu/libpython3.11.a` with a small increase in the time to compile Python. Run-time results do not appear to show any benefit from doing this.

Configuring Python 3
--------------------

In order for **python3** to find the installed documentation, create the following version independent symlink:

```bash
ln -svfn python-3.11.2 /usr/share/doc/python-3
```

and add the following environment variable to the individual user's or system's profile:

```bash
export PYTHONDOCS=/usr/share/doc/python-3/html
```

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** 2to3 (symlink) and 2to3-3.11, idle3 (symlink) and idle3.11, pip3 (symlink) and pip3.11, pydoc3 and pydoc3.11, python3 (symlink); python3.11, and python3-config (symlink) and python3.11-config

**Installed Libraries:** libpython3.11.so and libpython3.so

**Installed Directories:** /usr/include/python3.11, /usr/lib/python3.11, and /usr/share/doc/python-3.11.2

### Short Descriptions

**idle3**               is a wrapper script that opens a Python aware GUI editor. For this script to run, you must have installed Tk before Python so that the Tkinter Python module is built.

**pydoc3**              is the Python documentation tool.

**python3**             is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

**python3.11**          is a version-specific name for the **python** program.


## 13.24 Python Modules
--------

Introduction to Python Modules
------------------------------

The Python module packages add useful objects to the Python language. Modules utilized by packages throughout BLFS are listed here, along with their dependencies.

### Important

In BLFS, we normally build and install Python 3 modules with **pip3**. Please take care that the **pip3 install** commands in the book should be run as `root` unless it's for a Python virtual environment. Running **pip3 install** as a non-`root` user may seem to work fine, but it will cause the installed module to be inaccessible by other users.

**pip3 install** will not reinstall an already installed module by default. For using the **pip3 install** command to upgrade a module (for example, from meson-0.61.3 to meson-0.62.0), insert `--upgrade` into the command line. If it's really necessary to downgrade a module or reinstall the same version for some reason, insert `--force-reinstall` into the command line.
    

Asciidoc-10.2.0
---------------

#### Introduction to Asciidoc Module

The Asciidoc package is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, and man page.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

#### Package Information

#### Installation of Asciidoc

Build the module:

```bash
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist --no-cache-dir --no-user asciidoc
```

#### Command Explanations

`-w dist`: builds the appropriate "wheel" for this module in the directory `dist`.

`--no-build-isolation`: tells pip3 to run the build in the system environment instead of creating a temporary build environment.

`--no-deps`: prevents pip3 from building wheels for the project's dependencies.

`--no-index`: ignores the package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).

`--find-links dist`: looks for links to archives such as wheel (.whl) files in the directory `dist`.

`--no-cache-dir`: disables the cache to prevent a warning when installing as the `root` user.

`--no-user`: Prevent mistakenly running the install command as a non-root user.

`--upgrade`: Upgrade the package to the newest available version. This option is used with the install command if a version of the package is already installed.

`--force-reinstall`: Reinstall the package even if it is up-to-date. This option is used with the install command if reinstalling the package or reverting to an earlier version of the package.

`--no-deps`: Do not install package dependencies. This option may be needed with the --upgrade or --force-reinstall options.

#### Contents

**Installed Programs:** a2x and asciidoc

**Installed Libraries:** None

CacheControl-0.12.11
--------------------

#### Introduction to CacheControl Module

CacheControl is a port of the caching algorithms in httplib2 for use with requests session object. It was written because httplib2's better support for caching is often mitigated by its lack of thread safety. The same is true of requests in terms of caching.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/docutils](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/docutils)

#### Installation of docutils

To build the Python 3 applications, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD
```

To install the Python applications run the following as the `root` user:

```bash
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist --no-cache-dir --no-user docutils &&

for f in /usr/bin/rst*.py; do
  ln -svf $(basename $f) /usr/bin/$(basename $f .py)
done
```

To reduce the time needed for loading Python scripts, **pip3 install** will compile the scripts with extension `.py` into byte code and save the result into `.pyc` files in the directory `_pycache_`. But this package installs `.py` scripts into `/usr/bin`. So the byte code files for them will be installed into `/usr/bin/__pycache_`, which is not allowed by FHS. Still as the `root` user, remove this directory:

```bash
rm -rfv /usr/bin/__pycache__
```

#### Command Explanations

`-w dist`: builds the appropriate "wheel" for this module in the directory `dist`.

`--no-build-isolation`: tells pip3 to run the build in the system environment instead of creating a temporary build environment.

`--no-deps`: prevents pip3 from building wheels for the project's dependencies.

`--no-index`: ignores the package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).

`--find-links dist`: looks for links to archives such as wheel (.whl) files in the directory `dist`.

`--no-cache-dir`: disables the cache to prevent a warning when installing as the `root` user.

`--no-user`: Prevent mistakenly running the install command as a non-root user.

`--upgrade`: Upgrade the package to the newest available version. This option is used with the install command if a version of the package is already installed.

`--force-reinstall`: Reinstall the package even if it is up-to-date. This option is used with the install command if reinstalling the package or reverting to an earlier version of the package.

`--no-deps`: Do not install package dependencies. This option may be needed with the --upgrade or --force-reinstall options.

libxml2-2.10.3 (for its Python2 module)
---------------------------------------

#### Introduction to the libxml2 Python2 module

These instructions provide the Python2 bindings for libxml2: the Python3 bindings are built as part of [libxml2-2.10.3](9.General_libraries.md#967-libxml2-2103) and most packages in the book do not use these bindings for the older Python2.

By building these bindings after [libxml2-2.10.3](9.General_libraries.md#967-libxml2-2103) has been installed, there is no need to rebuild the time-consuming (if all dependencies are used) main part of that package.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

*   Download MD5 sum: 09b752e0b0a672d805ae54455c128d42
    
*   Download size: 106 KB
    
*   Estimated disk space required: 1.4 MB (add 129 MB for tests)
    
*   Estimated build time: less than 0.1 SBU (0.8 SBU for tests)
    

#### Additional Download

*   Recommended patch: [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/11.3/requests-2.28.2-use_system_certs-1.patch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/blfs/11.3/requests-2.28.2-use_system_certs-1.patch)
    

#### Requests Dependencies

##### Required

[charset-normalizer-3.0.1](13.Programming.md#1325-python-dependencies), [idna-3.4](13.Programming.md#1325-python-dependencies), and [urllib3-1.26.14](13.Programming.md#1325-python-dependencies)

##### Recommended

[make-ca-1.12](4.Security.md#42-make-ca-112), with [p11-kit-0.24.1](4.Security.md#419-p11-kit-0241) (both needed to use system https: certificates, removing an unnecessary dependency on the Certifi module).

##### Optional

[PySocks](https://pypi.org/project/PySocks/) (also needed for testing)

##### Optional (for testing)

[pytest-7.2.1](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules), [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)<2, [httpbin](https://pypi.org/project/httpbin/), [MarkupSafe](https://pypi.org/project/MarkupSafe/)<2.1, [pytest-mock](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock/), [pytest-httpbin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-httpbin/), [sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx/)<5, [trustme](https://pypi.org/project/trustme/), and [Werkzeug](https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/)<2

#### Installation of Requests

First apply a patch so that the same environment variable already used to point to system certificates in Python3 following the installation of make-ca can also be used by this module:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i ../requests-2.28.2-use_system_certs-1.patch
```

Build the module:

```bash
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist --no-cache-dir --no-user requests
```

Assuming [pytest-7.2.1](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) is installed, but the other optional dependencies are not, the installation can be tested with the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages testenv &&
source testenv/bin/activate                    &&
pip3 install --force-reinstall sphinx\<5       &&
pip3 install pytest-mock    \
             werkzeug\<2    \
             flask\<2       \
             pytest-httpbin \
             pysocks        \
             trustme                           &&
pip3 install --force-reinstall Markupsafe\<2.1 &&
python3 /usr/bin/pytest tests                  &&
deactivate
```

### Note

See [make-ca-1.12](4.Security.md#42-make-ca-112) for how to set the environment variable, and for how local copies of the Certifi and Requests modules installed in a virtual environment will override the system certificates.

#### Command Explanations

## 13.25 Python Dependencies
--------

Introduction to Python Dependencies
-----------------------------------

Python modules listed in [Python Modules](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) have dependencies that are not referenced by other packages in BLFS. These dependencies are listed here. They will not get updated on regular basis, unless a more recent version is needed.

### Important

In BLFS, we normally build and install Python 3 modules with **pip3**. Please take care that the **pip3 install** commands in the book should be run as `root` unless it's for a Python virtual environment. Running **pip3 install** as a non-`root` user may seem to work fine, but it will cause the installed module to be inaccessible by other users.

**pip3 install** will not reinstall an already installed module by default. For using the **pip3 install** command to upgrade a module (for example, from meson-0.61.3 to meson-0.62.0), insert `--upgrade` into the command line. If it's really necessary to downgrade a module or reinstall the same version for some reason, insert `--force-reinstall` into the command line.    

Alabaster-0.7.13

#### Setuptools_scm Dependencies

##### Required

[packaging-23.0](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules) and [typing_extensions-4.4.0](13.Programming.md#1325-python-dependencies)

##### Optional (for testing)

[git-2.39.2](13.Programming.md#139-git-2392), [Mercurial-6.3.2](13.Programming.md#1316-mercurial-632), and [pytest-7.2.1](13.Programming.md#1324-python-modules)

#### Installation of Setuptools_scm

Build the module:

```bash
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD
```

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist --no-cache-dir --no-user setuptools_scm
```

The installation can be tested with **pytest**. A few tests may fail if your git configuration is not the one expected by the test suite.

#### Command Explanations

`-w dist`: builds the appropriate "wheel" for this module in the directory `dist`.

`--no-build-isolation`: tells pip3 to run the build in the system environment instead of creating a temporary build environment.

`--no-deps`: prevents pip3 from building wheels for the project's dependencies.

`--no-index`: ignores the package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).

`--find-links dist`: looks for links to archives such as wheel (.whl) files in the directory `dist`.

`--no-cache-dir`: disables the cache to prevent a warning when installing as the `root` user.

`--no-user`: Prevent mistakenly running the install command as a non-root user.

`--upgrade`: Upgrade the package to the newest available version. This option is used with the install command if a version of the package is already installed.

`--force-reinstall`: Reinstall the package even if it is up-to-date. This option is used with the install command if reinstalling the package or reverting to an earlier version of the package.

`--no-deps`: Do not install package dependencies. This option may be needed with the --upgrade or --force-reinstall options.

Snowballstemmer-2.2.0
---------------------

#### Introduction to Snowballstemmer Module

The Snowballstemmer package is a small string processing language for creating stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval, plus a collection of stemming algorithms implemented using it. Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common “stem” — for example, the English stemmer maps connection, connections, connective, connected, and connecting to connect. So a searching for connected would also find documents which only have the other forms.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ruby](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/ruby)

Installation of Ruby
--------------------

Install Ruby by running the following command:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr      \
            --enable-shared    \
            --without-valgrind \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/ruby-3.2.1 &&
make
```

Optionally, build the CAPI documents by running the following commands:

```bash
make capi
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**. There are over 25,000 tests. Some tests related to ipv6 may indicate errors. If the tests are run in a directory that has a world writable component (e.g. /tmp) then several additional tests may fail. A few tests may fail due to system configuration expectations.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

### Note

If you have Ruby-On-Rails applications installed and did an upgrade of Ruby by installing this package, you might need to run an update there, too (as the `root` user):

```bash
cd /path/to/web/app
bundle update rake
```

and restart the webserver which serves the application.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--enable-shared`: This switch enables building the `libruby` shared library.

`--disable-install-doc`: This switch disables building and installing rdoc indexes and C API documents.

`--disable-install-rdoc`: This switch disables building and installing rdoc indexes.

`--disable-install-capi`: This switch disables building and installing C API documents.

`--without-baseruby`: This switch prevents using the system **ruby** if it is already installed. The build system will use the newly built version instead.

## 13.27 Rustc-1.67.1
--------

Introduction to Rust
--------------------

The Rust programming language is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language.

This package is updated on a six-weekly release cycle. Because it is such a large and slow package to build, is at the moment only required by a few packages in this book, and particularly because newer versions tend to break older mozilla packages, the BLFS editors take the view that it should only be updated when that is necessary (either to fix problems, or to allow a new version of a package to build).

As with many other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler) needs a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0 binary at the start of the build, so you cannot compile it without an Internet connection.

### Note

Although BLFS usually installs in `/usr`, when you later upgrade to a newer version of rust the old libraries in `/usr/lib/rustlib` will remain, with various hashes in their names, but will not be usable and will waste space. The editors recommend placing the files in the `/opt` directory. In particular, if you have reason to rebuild with a modified configuration (e.g. using the shipped LLVM after building with shared LLVM, perhaps to compile crates for architectures which the BLFS LLVM build does not support) it is possible for the install to leave a broken **cargo** program. In such a situation, either remove the existing installation first, or use a different prefix such as /opt/rustc-1.67.1-build2.

If you prefer, you can of course change the prefix to `/usr`.

The current rustbuild build-system will use all processors, although it does not scale well and often falls back to just using one core while waiting for a library to compile. However it can be mostly limited to a specified number of processors by a combination of adding the switch `--jobs <N>` (e.g. '--jobs 4' to limit to 4 processors) on each invocation of **python3 ./x.py** and using an environment variable `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=<N>`. At the moment this is not effective when some of the rustc tests are run.

The current version of rust's num_cpus crate now recognizes that cgroups can be used to restrict which processors it is allowed to use. So if your machine lacks DRAM (typically, less than 2GB DRAM per core) that might be an alternative to taking CPUs offline. That can be achieved by using **systemd-run** command with `-p User=$(whoami)` and `-p AllowedCPUs=0-x` (with `x` replaced with the number of CPU cores you want to use minus one) options.

At the moment Rust does not provide any guarantees of a stable ABI.

### Note

Rustc defaults to building for ALL supported architectures, using a shipped copy of LLVM. In BLFS the build is only for the X86 architecture. If you intend to develop rust crates, this build may not be good enough for your purposes.

The build times of this version when repeated on the same machine are often reasonably consistent, but as with all compilations using **rustc** there can be some very slow outliers.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Rust Dependencies

#### Required

[CMake-3.25.2](13.Programming.md#134-cmake-3252)

#### Recommended

[cURL-7.88.1](17.Networking_libraries.md#172-curl-7881), [libssh2-1.10.0](9.General_libraries.md#957-libssh2-1100), and [LLVM-15.0.7](13.Programming.md#1313-llvm-1507) (built with -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON so that rust can link to system LLVM instead of building its shipped version)

### Note

If a recommended dependency is not installed, a shipped copy in the Rustc source tarball will be built and used.

#### Optional

[GDB-13.1](13.Programming.md#138-gdb-131) (used by the test suite if it is present) and [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rust](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/rust)

Installation of Rust
--------------------

### Note

Currently Rust compiler produces SSE2 instructions for 32-bit x86, causing the generated code broken on 32-bit systems without a SSE2-capable processor. All x86 processor models released after 2004 should be SSE2-capable. Run **lscpu | grep sse2** as a test. If it outputs anything, your CPU is SSE2-capable and OK. Otherwise you may try to build this package on a SSE2-capable system with the following fix applied:

```bash
sed 's@pentium4@pentiumpro@' -i \
    compiler/rustc_target/src/spec/i686_unknown_linux_gnu.rs
```

And copy the resulting `/opt/rustc-1.67.1` to the system without SSE2 capability. But this change is still under upstream review and not tested by BLFS editors.

To install into the `/opt` directory, remove any existing `/opt/rustc` symlink and create a new directory (i.e. with a different name if trying a modified build of the same version). As the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -pv /opt/rustc-1.67.1      &&
ln -svfn rustc-1.67.1 /opt/rustc
```

### Note

If multiple versions of Rust are installed in `/opt`, changing to another version only requires changing the `/opt/rustc` symbolic link and then running **ldconfig**.

Create a suitable `config.toml` file which will configure the build.

```bash
cat << EOF > config.toml
# see config.toml.example for more possible options
# See the 8.4 book for an old example using shipped LLVM
# e.g. if not installing clang, or using a version before 13.0

# tell x.py to not keep printing an annoying warning
changelog-seen = 2

[llvm]
# by default, rust will build for a myriad of architectures
targets = "X86"

# When using system llvm prefer shared libraries
link-shared = true

[build]
# omit docs to save time and space (default is to build them)
docs = false

# install extended tools: cargo, clippy, etc
extended = true

# Do not query new versions of dependencies online.
locked-deps = true

# Specify which extended tools (those from the default install).
tools = ["cargo", "clippy", "rustfmt"]

# Use the source code shipped in the tarball for the dependencies.
# The combination of this and the "locked-deps" entry avoids downloading
# many crates from Internet, and makes the Rustc build more stable.
vendor = true

[install]
prefix = "/opt/rustc-1.67.1"
docdir = "share/doc/rustc-1.67.1"

[rust]
channel = "stable"
description = "for BLFS 11.3"

# BLFS used to not install the FileCheck executable from llvm,
# so disabled codegen tests.  The assembly tests rely on FileCheck
# and cannot easily be disabled, so those will anyway fail if
# FileCheck has not been installed.
#codegen-tests = false

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# NB the output of llvm-config (i.e. help options) may be
# dumped to the screen when config.toml is parsed.
llvm-config = "/usr/bin/llvm-config"

[target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu]
# NB the output of llvm-config (i.e. help options) may be
# dumped to the screen when config.toml is parsed.
llvm-config = "/usr/bin/llvm-config"


EOF
```

Compile Rust by running the following commands:

```bash
{ [ ! -e /usr/include/libssh2.h ] ||
  export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1; } &&
python3 ./x.py build
```

### Note

The test suite will generate some messages in the systemd journal for traps on invalid opcodes, and for segmentation faults. In themselves these are nothing to worry about, just a way for the test to be terminated.

To run the tests (again using all available CPUs) issue:

```bash
python3 ./x.py test --verbose --no-fail-fast | tee rustc-testlog
```

If **FileCheck** from LLVM has not been installed, all 47 tests from the “assembly” suite will fail.

As with all large test suites, other tests might fail on some machines - if the number of additional failures is in the single digits, check the log for 'failures:' and review lines above that, particularly the 'stderr:' lines. Any mention of SIGSEGV or signal 11 in a failing test is a cause for concern.

If you get any other failing test which reports an issue number then you should search for that issue. For example, when rustc >= 1.41.1 was built with a version of sysllvm before 10.0 the test for issue 69225 failed [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225) and that should be regarded as a critical failure (they released 1.41.1 because of it). Most other failures will not be critical.

Therefore, you should determine the number of failures.

The number of tests which passed and failed can be found by running:

```bash
grep '^test result:' rustc-testlog |
 awk '{sum1 += $4; sum2 += $6} END { print sum1 " passed; " sum2 " failed" }'
```

The other available fields are $8 for those which were ignored (i.e. skipped), $10 for 'measured' and $12 for 'filtered out' but both those last two are probably zero.

Now, as the `root` user, install the package:

### Note

If **sudo** or **su** is invoked for switching to the `root` user, ensure `LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG` is correctly passed or the following command may completely rebuild this package. For **sudo**, use the `--preserve-env=LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG` option. For **su**, do not use the `-` or `--login`.

```bash
python3 ./x.py install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**ln -svfn rustc-1.67.1 /opt/rustc**: if this is not the first use of the `/opt/rustc` symlink, overwrite it by forcing, and use the '-n' flag to avoid getting confusing results from e.g. **ls -l**.

**targets = "X86"**: this avoids building all the available linux cross-compilers (AArch64, MIPS, PowerPC, SystemZ, etc). Unfortunately, rust insists on installing source files for these below `/opt/rustc/lib/src`.

**extended = true**: this installs several tools (specified by the `tools` entry) alongside **rustc**.

**tools = ["cargo", "clippy", "rustfmt"]**: if the tools are not scecified, the absence of Miri now causes the install to fail. But Miri is not built in the stable channel. Some of the other tools are unlikely to be useful unless using (old) code analyzers or editing the standard library. This set match those from the 'default' profile in binary command **rustup** which are recommended for most users, except that the documentation was disabled at the start of the '[build]' section.

**channel = "stable"**: this ensures only stable features can be used, the default in `config.toml` is to use development features, which is not appropriate for a released version.

**[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]**: the syntax of `config.toml` requires an `llvm-config` entry for each target for which system-llvm is to be used. Change the target to `[target.i686-unknown-linux-gnu]` if you are building on 32-bit x86. This whole section may be omitted if you wish to build against the shipped llvm, or do not have clang, but the resulting build will be larger and take longer.

**export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1**: Allow **cargo** to link to system libssh2.

**--verbose**: this switch can sometimes provide more information about a test which fails.

**--no-fail-fast**: this switch ensures that the test suite will not stop at the first error.

Configuring Rust
----------------

#### Configuration Information

If you installed rustc in `/opt`, you need to update the following configuration files so that rustc is correctly found by other packages and system processes.

As the `root` user, create the `/etc/profile.d/rustc.sh` file:

```bash
cat > /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh << "EOF"
# Begin /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh

pathprepend /opt/rustc/bin           PATH

# Include /opt/rustc/man in the MANPATH variable to access manual pages
pathappend  /opt/rustc/share/man     MANPATH

# End /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh
EOF
```

Immediately after installation, update the current PATH for your current shell as a normal user:

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/rustc.sh
```

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/subversion](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/subversion)

Installation of Subversion
--------------------------

First, adapt some Python scripts to use python3:

```bash
grep -rl '^#!.*python$' | xargs sed -i '1s/python/&3/'
```

Next, adapt the Ruby bindings to Ruby-3.2:

```bash
sed -e 's/File.exists?/File.exist?/'               \
    -i subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/svn/util.rb   \
       subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/test/test_wc.rb
```

Install Subversion by running the following commands:

```bash
PYTHON=python3 ./configure --prefix=/usr             \
            --disable-static          \
            --with-apache-libexecdir  \
            --with-lz4=internal       \
            --with-utf8proc=internal &&
make
```

If you have [Doxygen-1.9.6](13.Programming.md#135-doxygen-196) installed and you wish to build the API documentation, issue:

```bash
doxygen doc/doxygen.conf
```

If you wish to build the Java bindings pass the `--enable-javahl` parameter to the **configure** command. In addition, if you want to run the Java test suite, you have to specify the location of the JUnit file by adding `--with-junit=<path to junit jar>` (for instance `--with-junit=/usr/local/java/lib/junit-4.13.jar`) to **configure**. The JUnit jar file is no longer included in [apache-ant-1.10.13](13.Programming.md#1341-apache-ant-11013) and must be downloaded separately. To build the Java bindings, issue the following command:

```bash
make -j1 javahl
```

If you want to compile Perl, Python, or Ruby bindings, issue any of the following command:

```bash
make swig-pl # for Perl
make swig-py \
     swig_pydir=/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/libsvn \
     swig_pydir_extra=/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/svn # for Python
make swig-rb # for Ruby
```

To test the results, issue: **make check**. Four tests in the `commit_tests.py`, `prop_tests.py`, and `update_tests.py` suites are known to fail.

To test the results of any of the SWIG bindings, you can use any of the following commands: **make check-swig-pl**, **make check-swig-py**, or **make check-swig-rb**.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&

install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/subversion-1.14.2 &&
cp      -v -R doc/* /usr/share/doc/subversion-1.14.2
```

If you built the Java bindings, issue the following command as the `root` user to install them:

```bash
make install-javahl
```

If you built the Perl, Python, or Ruby bindings, issue any of the following commands as the `root` user to install them:

```bash
make install-swig-pl
make install-swig-py \
      swig_pydir=/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/libsvn \
      swig_pydir_extra=/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/svn
make install-swig-rb
```

The java bindings need to be installed in order for the tests to run, since the tests attempt to look for them in CLASSPATH. To test the results of the Java bindings build, issue **LANG=C make check-javahl**.

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--disable-static`: This switch prevents installation of static versions of the libraries.

`--with-apache-libexecdir`: If [Apache-2.4.55](20.Major_servers.md#201-apache-2455) is installed, the shared Apache modules are built. This switch allows to have those modules installed to Apache's configured module dir instead of `/usr/libexec`. It has no effect if Apache is not installed.

`--with-lz4=internal, --with-utf8proc=internal`: Remove these switches if you have installed the optional dependencies.

`--enable-javahl`: enables compilation of Java high level bindings. Running **make javahl** is necessary to do the compilation.

`--with-junit=<location of the junit jar file>`: gives the location of the junit jar, otherwise the javahl tests cannot be run.

`--disable-gmock`: Do not use the Googlemock testing framework.

Configuring Subversion
----------------------

## 13.31 Running a Subversion Server
--------

Running a Subversion Server
---------------------------

This section will describe how to set up, administer and secure a Subversion server.

### Subversion Server Dependencies

#### Required

[Subversion-1.14.2](13.Programming.md#1330-subversion-1142) and [OpenSSH-9.2p1](4.Security.md#418-openssh-92p1)

Setting up a Subversion Server.
-------------------------------

The following instructions will install a Subversion server, which will be set up to use OpenSSH as the secure remote access method, with **svnserve** available for anonymous access.

Configuration of the Subversion server consists of the following steps:

#### 1. Set Uup Users, Groups, and Permissions

You'll need to be user `root` for the initial portion of configuration. Create the `svn` user and group with the following commands:

```bash
groupadd -g 56 svn &&
useradd -c "SVN Owner" -d /home/svn -m -g svn -s /bin/false -u 56 svn
```

If you plan to have multiple repositories, you should have a group dedicated to each repository for ease of administration. Create the `svntest` group for the test repository and add the `svn` user to that group with the following commands:

```bash
groupadd -g 57 svntest &&
usermod -G svntest -a svn
```

Additionally you should set **umask 002** while working with a repository so that all new files will be writable by owner and group. This is made mandatory by creating a wrapper script for **svn** and **svnserve**:

```bash
mv /usr/bin/svn /usr/bin/svn.orig &&
mv /usr/bin/svnserve /usr/bin/svnserve.orig &&
cat >> /usr/bin/svn << "EOF"
#!/bin/sh
umask 002
/usr/bin/svn.orig "$@"
EOF
cat >> /usr/bin/svnserve << "EOF"
#!/bin/sh
umask 002
/usr/bin/svnserve.orig "$@"
EOF
chmod 0755 /usr/bin/svn{,serve}
```

### Note

If you use Apache for working with the repository over HTTP, even for anonymous access, you should wrap **/usr/sbin/httpd** in a similar script.

#### 2. Create a Subversion repository.

There are several ways to set up a subversion repository. It is recommended to have a look at the [SVN Book](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.reposadmin.html) corresponding chapter. A basic repository can be set up with the instructions below.

Create a new Subversion repository with the following commands (as the `root` user):

```bash
install -v -m 0755 -d /srv/svn &&
install -v -m 0755 -o svn -g svn -d /srv/svn/repositories &&
svnadmin create /srv/svn/repositories/svntest
```

Now that the repository is created, it should be populated with something useful. You'll need to have a predefined directory layout set up exactly as you want your repository to look. For example, here is a sample BLFS layout setup with a root of `svntest/`. You'll need to set up a directory tree similar to the following:

```bash
svntest/                # The name of the repository
    trunk/              # Contains the existing source tree
        BOOK/
        bootscripts/
        edguide/
        patches/
        scripts/
    branches/           # Needed for additional branches
    tags/               # Needed for tagging release points
```

Once you've created your directory layout as shown above, you are ready to do the initial import:

```bash
svn import -m "Initial import." \
    </path/to/source/tree>      \
    file:///srv/svn/repositories/svntest
```

Now change owner and group information on the repository, and add an unprivileged user to the `svn` and `svntest` groups:

```bash
chown -R svn:svntest /srv/svn/repositories/svntest    &&
chmod -R g+w         /srv/svn/repositories/svntest    &&
chmod g+s            /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/db &&
usermod -G svn,svntest -a <username>
```

`svntest` is the group assigned to the svntest repository. As mentioned earlier, this eases administration of multiple repositories when using OpenSSH for authentication. Going forward, you'll need to add your unprivileged user, and any additional users that you wish to have write access to the repository, to the `svn` and `svntest` groups.

In addition, you'll notice that the new repository's `db` directory is set-groupID. If the reasoning is not immediately obvious, when using any external authentication method (such as **ssh**), the sticky bit is set so that all new files will be owned by the user, but group of `svntest`. Anyone in the `svntest` group can create files, but still give the entire group write access to those files. This avoids locking out other users from the repository.

Now, return to an unprivileged user account, and take a look at the new repository using **svnlook**:

```bash
svnlook tree /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/
```

### Note

You may need to log out and back in again to refresh your group memberships. **su `<username>`** should work as well.

#### 3. Configure the Server

As mentioned previously, these instructions will configure the server to use only **ssh** for write access to the repository and to provide anonymous access using **svnserve**. There are several other ways to provide access to the repository. These additional configurations are best explained at [https://svnbook.red-bean.com/](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/).

Access configuration needs to be done for each repository. Create the `svnserve.conf` file for the svntest repository using the following commands:

```bash
cp /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf \
   /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf.default &&

cat > /srv/svn/repositories/svntest/conf/svnserve.conf << "EOF"
[general]
anon-access = read
auth-access = write
EOF
```

There is not a lot to the configuration file at all. You'll notice that only the general section is required. Take a look at the `svnserve.conf.default` file for information on using **svnserve**'s built-in authentication method.

#### 4. Starting the Server

To start the server at boot time, install the `svnserve.service` unit from the [blfs-systemd-units-20220720](2.Important_information.md#24-blfs-systemd-units) package:

```bash
make install-svnserve
```

Additionally, the instructions above require that svn server uses **umask 002** so that all new files will be writable by owner and group. This can be achieved by creating a systemd unit override file by running the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/svnserve.service.d
echo "UMask=0002" > /etc/systemd/system/svnserve.service.d/99-user.conf
```

Options which are passed to **svnserve** daemon can be changed in `/etc/default/svnserve`.


## 13.32 SWIG-4.1.1
--------

Introduction to SWIG
--------------------

SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is a compiler that integrates C and C++ with languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, D, Go, Lua, Octave, R, Scheme, and Ocaml. SWIG can also export its parse tree into Lisp s-expressions and XML.

SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code (glue code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries available to the listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with a scripting language.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Package Information

*   Download (HTTP): [https://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-4.1.1.tar.gz](https://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-4.1.1.tar.gz)
    
*   Download MD5 sum: c7d55a1bca26752f3846c85b43c1a69c
    
*   Download size: 8.2 MB
    
*   Estimated disk space required: 82 MB (2.1 GB with tests)
    
*   Estimated build time: 0.1 SBU (add 7.8 SBU for tests; both using parallelism=4)
    

### SWIG Dependencies

#### Required

[pcre2-10.42](9.General_libraries.md#978-pcre2-1042)

#### Optional

[Boost-1.81.0](9.General_libraries.md#94-boost-1810) for tests, and any of the languages mentioned in the introduction, as run-time dependencies

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/swig](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/swig)

Installation of SWIG
--------------------

Install SWIG by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr                      \
            --without-javascript               \
            --without-maximum-compile-warnings &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **PY3=1 make -k check TCL_INCLUDE=**. The unsetting of the variable `TCL_INCLUDE` is necessary since it is not correctly set by configure. The tests are only executed for the languages installed on your machine, so the disk space and SBU values given for the tests may vary, and should be considered as mere orders of magnitude. According to SWIG's documentation, the failure of some tests should not be considered harmful. The go tests are buggy and may generate a lot of meaningless output.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&
install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/swig-4.1.1 &&
cp -v -R Doc/* /usr/share/doc/swig-4.1.1
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--without-maximum-compile-warnings`: disables compiler ansi conformance enforcement, which triggers errors in the Lua headers (starting with Lua 5.3).

`--without-<language>`: allows disabling the building of tests and examples for <language>, but all the languages capabilities of SWIG are always built.

### Tk Dependencies

#### Required

[Xorg Libraries](24.Graphical_environments.md#248-xorg-libraries)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tk](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/tk)

Installation of Tk
------------------

Install Tk by running the following commands:

```bash
cd unix &&
./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man \
            $([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit) &&

make &&

sed -e "s@^\(TK_SRC_DIR='\).*@\1/usr/include'@" \
    -e "/TK_B/s@='\(-L\)\?.*unix@='\1/usr/lib@" \
    -i tkConfig.sh
```

Running the tests is not recommended. Failures will be reported during the tests, depending on the screen resolution/capabilities, fonts installed and other X related parameters, but the end report can show 0 failures. Some tests will steal focus and some might crash your X Server. To test the results anyway, issue: **make test**. Ensure you run it from an X Window display device with the GLX extensions loaded, but even so, tests might hang.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install &&
make install-private-headers &&
ln -v -sf wish8.6 /usr/bin/wish &&
chmod -v 755 /usr/lib/libtk8.6.so
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`$([ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && echo --enable-64bit)`: This switch is used to enable 64 bit support in Tk on 64 bit operating systems.

**make install-private-headers**: This command is used to install the Tk library interface headers used by other packages if they link to the Tk library.

**ln -v -sf wish8.6 /usr/bin/wish**: This command is used to create a compatibility symbolic link to the **wish8.6** file as many packages expect a file named **wish**.

**sed -e ... tkConfig.sh**: The Tk package expects that its source tree is preserved so that packages depending on it for their compilation can utilize it. This **sed** removes the references to the build directory and replaces them with saner system-wide locations.

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** wish and wish8.6

**Installed Libraries:** libtk8.6.so and libtkstub8.6.a

**Installed Directory:** /usr/lib/tk8.6

### Short Descriptions

**wish**                is a symlink to the **wish8.6** program.

**wish8.6**             is a simple shell containing the Tk toolkit that creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.

`libtk8.6.so`           contains the API functions required by Tk.

### Valgrind Dependencies

#### Optional

[GDB-13.1](13.Programming.md#138-gdb-131) (for tests), [LLVM-15.0.7](13.Programming.md#1313-llvm-1507) (with Clang), and [Which-2.21](12.System_utilities.md#1235-which-221-and-alternatives) (for tests)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/valgrind](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/valgrind)

Installation of Valgrind
------------------------

Install Valgrind by running the following commands:

```bash
sed -i 's|/doc/valgrind||' docs/Makefile.in &&

./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --datadir=/usr/share/doc/valgrind-3.20.0 &&
make
```

To test the results, issue: **make regtest**. The tests may hang forever if [GDB-13.1](13.Programming.md#138-gdb-131) is not installed. Some tests are known to hang also, depending on the version of glibc. A few tests can fail in various suites. Problematic tests can be disabled by changing the **`prereq:`** line in the corresponding `.vgtest` file to **`prereq: false`**. For example:

```bash
sed -e 's@prereq:.*@prereq: false@' \
    -i {helgrind,drd}/tests/pth_cond_destroy_busy.vgtest
```

### Note

The OpenMP tests are skipped if libgomp has been compiled with `--enable-linux-futex` (the default). If needed, just recompile the libgomp library from the gcc build tree, passing `--disable-linux-futex` to configure, storing the library to some place and changing the link from `/usr/lib/libgomp.so.1` to point to the new library.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**sed -i ... docs/Makefile.in** : This sed provides for installing the documentation in a versioned directory.

`--enable-lto=yes`: This option allows building Valgrind with LTO (link time optimization). This produces a smaller/faster Valgrind (up to 10%), but build time increases to about 5.5 SBU.

Contents
--------

**Java**

## 13.38 Java-19.0.2
--------

About Java
----------

Java is different from most of the packages in LFS and BLFS. It is a programming language that works with files of bytecode to obtain instructions and executes them in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). An introductory java program looks like:

```bash
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

This program is saved as `HelloWorld.java`. The file name, HelloWorld, must match the class name. It is then converted into byte code with **javac HelloWorld.java**. The output file is `HelloWorld.class`. The program is executed with **java HelloWorld**. This creates a JVM and runs the code. The 'class' extension must not be specified.

Several class files can be combined into one file with the **jar** command. This is similar to the standard **tar** command. For instance, the command **jar cf myjar.jar *.class** will combine all class files in a directory into one jar file. These act as library files.

The JVM can search for and use classes in jar files automatically. It uses the `CLASSPATH` environment variable to search for jar files. This is a standard list of colon-separated directory names similar to the `PATH` environment variable.

Binary JDK Information
----------------------

Creating a JVM from source requires a set of circular dependencies. The first thing that's needed is a set of programs called a Java Development Kit (JDK). This set of programs includes **java**, **javac**, **jar**, and several others. It also includes several base jar files.

To start, we set up a binary installation of the JDK created by the BLFS editors. It is installed in the `/opt` directory to allow for multiple installations, including a source based version.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

Installation of the Java BinaryJDK
----------------------------------

Begin by extracting the appropriate binary tarball for your architecture and changing to the extracted directory. Install the binary OpenJDK with the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
install -vdm755 /opt/OpenJDK-19.0.2-bin &&
mv -v * /opt/OpenJDK-19.0.2-bin         &&
chown -R root:root /opt/OpenJDK-19.0.2-bin
```

The binary version is now installed. You may create a symlink to that version by issuing, as the `root` user:

```bash
ln -sfn OpenJDK-19.0.2-bin /opt/jdk
```

You may now proceed to [Configuring the JAVA environment](13.Programming.md#1340-configuring-the-java-environment), where the instructions assume that the above link exists.


## 13.39 OpenJDK-19.0.2
--------

Introduction to OpenJDK
-----------------------

OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of Oracle's Java Standard Edition platform. OpenJDK is useful for developing Java programs, and provides a complete runtime environment to run Java programs.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

OpenJDK is GPL'd code, with a special exception made for non-free projects to use these classes in their proprietary products. In similar fashion to the LGPL, which allows non-free programs to link to libraries provided by free software, the [GNU General Public License, version 2, with the Classpath Exception](https://openjdk.org/legal/gplv2+ce.html) allows third party programs to use classes provided by free software without the requirement that the third party software also be free. As with the LGPL, any modifications made to the free software portions of a third party application, must also be made freely available.

### Note

The OpenJDK source includes a very thorough, open source test suite using the JTreg test harness. The testing instructions below allow testing the just built JDK for reasonable compatibility with the proprietary Oracle JDK. However, in order for an independent implementation to claim compatibility, it must pass a proprietary JCK/TCK test suite. No claims of compatibility, or even partial compatibility, may be made without passing an approved test suite.

Oracle does provide free community access, on a case by case basis, to a closed toolkit to ensure 100% compatibility with its proprietary JDK. Neither the binary version provided on the [Java-19.0.2](13.Programming.md#1338-java-1902) page nor the JVM built with the instructions below have been tested against the [TCK](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-access.html). Any version that is built using the instructions given, cannot claim to be compatible with the proprietary JDK, without the user applying for, and completing the compatibility tests themselves.

With that in mind, the binaries produced using this build method are regularly tested against the TCK by the members listed on the site above. In addition to the community license above, an educational, non-commercial license for the TCK can be obtained [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-137188.html).

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openjdk](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/openjdk)

Installation of OpenJDK
-----------------------

If you have downloaded the optional test harness, unpack it now:

```bash
tar -xf ../jtreg-6.1+1.tar.gz
```

### Note

Before proceeding, you should ensure that your environment `PATH` variable contains the location of the Java compiler used for bootstrapping OpenJDK. This is the only requirement for the environment. Modern Java installations do not need `JAVA_HOME` and `CLASSPATH` is not used here. Furthermore, OpenJDK developers recommend unsetting `JAVA_HOME`.

The build system does not allow the `-j` switch in `MAKEFLAGS`. See the command explanation for `--with-jobs=` for more information on customizing parallelization.

Configure and build the package with the following commands:

```bash
unset JAVA_HOME                             &&
bash configure --enable-unlimited-crypto    \
               --disable-warnings-as-errors \
               --with-stdc++lib=dynamic     \
               --with-giflib=system         \
               --with-jtreg=$PWD/jtreg      \
               --with-lcms=system           \
               --with-libjpeg=system        \
               --with-libpng=system         \
               --with-zlib=system           \
               --with-version-build="7"     \
               --with-version-pre=""        \
               --with-version-opt=""        \
               --with-cacerts-file=/etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts &&
make images
```

To test the results, you will need to execute the jtreg program. You can set the number of concurrent tests by adding the `-conc:<X>` value in the below command (tests will run sequentially otherwise):

```bash
export JT_JAVA=$(echo $PWD/build/*/jdk) &&
jtreg/bin/jtreg -jdk:$JT_JAVA -automatic -ignore:quiet -v1 \
    test/jdk:tier1 test/langtools:tier1 &&
unset JT_JAVA
```

For more control over the test suite, review the documentation available in `jtreg/doc/jtreg/usage.txt`. To review the results, see the files `JTreport/test_{jdk,langtools}/text/stats.txt` and `JTreport/test_{jdk,langtools}/text/summary.txt`. You should expect to see around 60 failures and 10 errors.

Install the package with the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
install -vdm755 /opt/jdk-19.0.2+7             &&
cp -Rv build/*/images/jdk/* /opt/jdk-19.0.2+7 &&
chown -R root:root /opt/jdk-19.0.2+7          &&
for s in 16 24 32 48; do
  install -vDm644 src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/awt/X11/java-icon${s}.png \
                  /usr/share/icons/hicolor/${s}x${s}/apps/java.png
done
```

### Note

If you only wish to install the Java Runtime Environment, you can substitute `build/*/images/jre` in the above **cp** command.

There are now two OpenJDK SDKs installed in `/opt`. You should decide on which one you would like to use as the default. Normally, you would opt for the just installed OpenJDK. If so, do the following as the `root` user:

```bash
ln -v -nsf jdk-19.0.2+7 /opt/jdk
```

If desired, you can create .desktop files to add entries in the menu for **java** and **jconsole**. The needed icons have already been installed. As the `root` user:

```bash
mkdir -pv /usr/share/applications &&

cat > /usr/share/applications/openjdk-java.desktop << "EOF" &&
[Desktop Entry]
Name=OpenJDK Java 19.0.2 Runtime
Comment=OpenJDK Java 19.0.2 Runtime
Exec=/opt/jdk/bin/java -jar
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=java
MimeType=application/x-java-archive;application/java-archive;application/x-jar;
NoDisplay=true
EOF
cat > /usr/share/applications/openjdk-jconsole.desktop << "EOF"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=OpenJDK Java 19.0.2 Console
Comment=OpenJDK Java 19.0.2 Console
Keywords=java;console;monitoring
Exec=/opt/jdk/bin/jconsole
Terminal=false

Categories=Application;System;
EOF
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**bash configure...**: the top level `configure` is a wrapper around the autotools one. It is not executable and must be run through **bash**.

`--enable-unlimited-crypto`: Because of limitations on the usage of cryptography in some countries, there is the possibility to limit the size of encryption keys and the use of some algorithms in a policy file. This switch allows to ship a policy file with no restriction. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure proper adherence to the law.

`--disable-warnings-as-errors`: This switch disables use of `-Werror` in the build.

`--with-stdc++lib=dynamic`: This switch forces the build system to link to `libstdc++.so` (dynamic) instead of `libstdc++.a` (static).

`--with-jobs=<X>`: The `-j` passed to make does not work with make as invoked here. By default, the build system will use the number of CPUs - 1.

`--with-jtreg=$PWD/jtreg`: This switch tells configure where to find jtreg. Omit if you have not downloaded the optional test suite.

`--with-{giflib,lcms,libjpeg,libpng,zlib}=system`: These switches force the build system to use the system libraries instead of the bundled versions.

`--with-version-build`: Currently, the build system does not include the build number in the version string. It has to be specified here.

`--with-version-pre`: This switch allows you to prefix the version string with a custom string.

`--with-version-opt`: This switch allows you to add an optional build description to the version string.

`--with-cacerts-file=/etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts`: Specifies where to find a `cacerts` file, `/etc/pki/tls/java/` on a BLFS system. Otherwise, an empty one is created. You can use the **/usr/sbin/make-ca --force** command to generate it, once you have installed the Java binaries.

`--with-boot-jdk`: This switch provides the location of the temporary JDK. It is normally not needed if **java** is found in the `PATH`.

Configuring OpenJDK
-------------------

#### Configuration Information

Normally, the JAVA environment has been configured after installing the binary version, and can be used with the just built package as well. Review [Configuring the JAVA environment](13.Programming.md#1340-configuring-the-java-environment) in case you want to modify something.

To test if the man pages are correctly installed, issue **source /etc/profile** and **man java** to display the respective man page.

#### Setting up the JRE Certificate Authority Certificates (cacerts) file

If you have run the instructions on the [make-ca-1.12](4.Security.md#42-make-ca-112) page, you only need to create a symlink in the default location for the `cacerts` file. As user `root`:

```bash
ln -sfv /etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts /opt/jdk/lib/security/cacerts
```

To check the installation, issue:

```bash
cd /opt/jdk
bin/keytool -list -cacerts
```

At the prompt `Enter keystore password:`, enter **`changeit`** (the default) or just press the “Enter” key. If the `cacerts` file was installed correctly, you will see a list of the certificates with related information for each one. If not, you need to reinstall them.

## 13.40 Configuring the JAVA environment
--------

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

After the package installation is complete, the next step is to make sure that the system can properly find the files. If you set up your login scripts as recommended in [The Bash Shell Startup Files](3.After_lfs_configuration_issues.md#37-the-bash-shell-startup-files), update the environment by creating the `openjdk.sh` script, as the `root` user:

```bash
cat > /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh << "EOF"
# Begin /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh

# Set JAVA_HOME directory
JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk

# Adjust PATH
pathappend $JAVA_HOME/bin

# Add to MANPATH
pathappend $JAVA_HOME/man MANPATH

# Auto Java CLASSPATH: Copy jar files to, or create symlinks in, the
# /usr/share/java directory.

AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR=/usr/share/java

pathprepend . CLASSPATH

for dir in `find ${AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR} -type d 2>/dev/null`; do
    pathappend $dir CLASSPATH
done

for jar in `find ${AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR} -name "*.jar" 2>/dev/null`; do
    pathappend $jar CLASSPATH
done

export JAVA_HOME
unset AUTO_CLASSPATH_DIR dir jar

# End /etc/profile.d/openjdk.sh
EOF
```

If [Sudo-1.9.13p1](4.Security.md#425-sudo-1913p1) is installed, the super user should have access to the above variables. Execute the following commands as the `root` user:

```bash
cat > /etc/sudoers.d/java << "EOF"
Defaults env_keep += JAVA_HOME
Defaults env_keep += CLASSPATH
EOF
```

To use **mandb** to include the OpenJDK man pages in its database, issue, as the `root` user:

```bash
cat >> /etc/man_db.conf << "EOF" &&
# Begin Java addition
MANDATORY_MANPATH     /opt/jdk/man
MANPATH_MAP           /opt/jdk/bin     /opt/jdk/man
MANDB_MAP             /opt/jdk/man     /var/cache/man/jdk
# End Java addition
EOF

mkdir -p /var/cache/man &&
mandb -c /opt/jdk/man
```

Setting up the Certificate Authority Certificates for Java
----------------------------------------------------------

OpenJDK uses its own format for the CA certificates. The Java security modules use `$JAVA_HOME``/lib/security/cacerts` by default. In order to keep all the certificates in one place, we use `/etc/ssl/java/cacerts`. The instructions on the [make-ca-1.12](4.Security.md#42-make-ca-112) page previously created the file located in `/etc/ssl/java`. Set up a symlink in the default location as the `root` user:

```bash
ln -sfv /etc/pki/tls/java/cacerts /opt/jdk/lib/security/cacerts
```

Use the following command to check if the `cacerts` file has been successfully installed:

```bash
/opt/jdk/bin/keytool -list -cacerts
```

At the prompt `Enter keystore password:`, enter **`changeit`** (the default) or just press the “Enter” key. If the `cacerts` file was installed correctly, you will see a list of the certificates with related information for each one. If not, you need to reinstall them.

If you later install a new JVM, you just have to create the symlink in the default location to be able to use the cacerts.


## 13.41 apache-ant-1.10.13
--------

Introduction to Apache Ant
--------------------------

The Apache Ant package is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is like the **make** command, but without **make**'s wrinkles. Ant is different. Instead of a model that is extended with shell-based commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree that executes various tasks. Each task is run by an object that implements a particular task interface.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS 11.3 platform.

### Package Information

*   Download size: 3.7 MB
    
*   Estimated disk space required: 242 MB
    
*   Estimated build time: 0.3 SBU (excluding download time)
    

### Apache Ant Dependencies

#### Required

A JDK ([Java Binary](13.Programming.md#1338-java-1902) or [OpenJDK-19.0.2](13.Programming.md#1339-openjdk-1902)) and [GLib-2.74.5](9.General_libraries.md#913-glib-2745)

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/apache-ant](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/apache-ant)

Installation of Apache Ant
--------------------------

Build a limited bootstrap version of Apache Ant using the following command:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Now fix a problem when the next command tries to download a file from a problem site:

```bash
sed -e 's|ftp.software.ibm.com|anduin.linuxfromscratch.org|' \
    -e 's|software/awdtools/netrexx|BLFS/apache-ant|'        \
    -i fetch.xml 
```

Download the runtime dependencies using the `fetch.xml` ant build script:

```bash
bootstrap/bin/ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=optional
```

Build Apache Ant by running the following command:

```bash
./build.sh -Ddist.dir=$PWD/ant-1.10.13 dist
```

Install, as the `root` user:

```bash
cp -rv ant-1.10.13 /opt/            &&
chown -R root:root /opt/ant-1.10.13 &&
ln -sfv ant-1.10.13 /opt/ant
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

**bootstrap/bin/ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=optional**: Downloads the missing dependencies to the user's home directory, and copies them into the source tree (in the `lib/optional` directory, where **ant** picks them up at build time).

**./build.sh -Ddist.dir=$PWD/ant-1.10.13 dist**: This command builds, tests, then installs the package into a temporary directory.

Configuring Apache Ant
----------------------

#### Config Files

`/etc/ant/ant.conf`, `~/.ant/ant.conf`, and `~/.antrc`

#### Configuration Information

Some packages will require **ant** to be in the search path and the `ANT_HOME` environment variable defined. Satisfy these requirements by issuing, as the `root` user:

```bash
cat > /etc/profile.d/ant.sh << EOF
# Begin /etc/profile.d/ant.sh

pathappend /opt/ant/bin
export ANT_HOME=/opt/ant

# End /etc/profile.d/ant.sh
EOF
```

The above instructions assume you have configured your system as described in [The Bash Shell Startup Files](3.After_lfs_configuration_issues.md#37-the-bash-shell-startup-files).

Contents
--------

**Installed Programs:** ant, antRun, antRun.pl, complete-ant-cmd.pl, runant.pl, and runant.py

**Installed Libraries:** Numerous `ant*.jar` and dependent libraries in `$ANT_HOME``/lib`

**Installed Directories:** /opt/ant-1.10.13

### Short Descriptions

**ant**                 is a Java based build tool used by many packages instead of the conventional **make** program.

**antRun**              is a support script used to start **ant** build scripts in a given directory.

**antRun.pl**           is a Perl script that provides similar functionality offered by the **antRun** script.

**complete-ant-cmd.pl** is a Perl script that allows Bash to complete an **ant** command-line.

**runant.pl**           is a Perl wrapper script used to invoke **ant**.

**runant.py**           is a Python wrapper script used to invoke **ant**.

`ant*.jar`              files are the Apache Ant Java class libraries.
