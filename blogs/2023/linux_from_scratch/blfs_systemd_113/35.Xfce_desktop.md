# 35. Xfce Desktop
--------

Xfce is a desktop environment that aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment.

Build Xfce core packages in the order presented in the book for the easiest resolution of dependencies.

User Notes: [https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xfce4-session](https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/wiki/xfce4-session)

Installation of Xfce4 Session
-----------------------------

Install Xfce4 Session by running the following commands:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --sysconfdir=/etc \
            --disable-legacy-sm &&
make
```

This package does not come with a test suite.

Now, as the `root` user:

```bash
make install
```

Command Explanations
--------------------

`--disable-legacy-sm`: This switch disables legacy session management which isn't necessary on modern system.

Configuring Xfce4 Session
-------------------------

There are several optional run time dependencies for Xfce4: [dbus-1.14.6](12.System_utilities.md#1210-dbus-1146), [GnuPG-2.4.0](4.Security.md#46-gnupg-240), [hicolor-icon-theme-0.17](28.Icons.md#287-hicolor-icon-theme-017) and [OpenSSH-9.2p1](4.Security.md#418-openssh-92p1)

When building an Xfce4 package, some configuration files are installed in `/usr/share/applications`, `/usr/share/icons`, and `/usr/share/mime`. In order to use those files in your Xfce4 session, you need to update various databases. Do that by running, as the `root` user (you need to have the recommended dependencies installed):

```bash
update-desktop-database &&
update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
```

Starting Xfce4
--------------

You can start Xfce4 from a TTY using [xinit-1.4.2](24.Graphical_environments.md#2428-xinit-142), or from a graphical display manager, such as [lightdm-1.32.0](26.Display_managers.md#262-lightdm-1320).

To start Xfce4 using [xinit-1.4.2](24.Graphical_environments.md#2428-xinit-142), run the following commands:

```bash
cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
dbus-launch --exit-with-x11 startxfce4
EOF

startx
```

The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7. You can switch to another vt_n_ simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-F_n_ (_n_\=1, 2, ...). To switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7, use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt where the command **startx** was executed will display many messages, including X starting messages, applications automatically started with the session, and eventually, some warning and error messages. You may prefer to redirect those messages to a log file, which not only will keep the initial vt uncluttered, but can also be used for debugging purposes. This can be done starting X with:

```bash
startx &> ~/.x-session-errors
```

When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt where X was running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously press keys Alt-F7 (assuming that X was running on vt7).
